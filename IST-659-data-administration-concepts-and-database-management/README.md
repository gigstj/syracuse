IST 659: Data Administration Concepts and Database Management

This course provides a foundation for database administration, exploring the fundamental models of database management systems. It covers the definition, development and management of databases for information systems.

Students learn data analysis techniques, data modeling, schema design, query languages and search specifications, including Structured Query Language (SQL), data structures, file organizations, principles of data management systems, and hierarchical, network and relational data models. Students gain hands-on experience using Microsoftâ€™s Access and SQL Server database management systems (DBMS) as implementation vehicles.

This course provides hands-on experience in database design and implementation through assignments, lab exercises and course projects. This course also introduces advanced database concepts such as transaction management and concurrency control, distributed databases, multitier client/server architectures, web-based database applications, data warehousing and NoSQL.
