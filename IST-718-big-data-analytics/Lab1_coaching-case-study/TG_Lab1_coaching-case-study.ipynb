    "Colleges operate on tight budgets so they are always looking for opportunities to cut cost. There is a balancing act because they need to carefully decide where to allocate their money. Spending too much money in one area might mean that another area is not getting enough money and vice versa. Football programs, being that they are usually the dominant sport at most schools, are notorious for consuming a lot of resources. In this report, I will be analyzing data related to football head coach salaries at division I colleges. Which coaches are overpaid and which coaches are undepraid? What are the most important variables that should be considered when deciding coach pay? These are the type of questions that I hope to answer.\n",

More specifically, I will be gathering win / loss percentages, conference champions, and coach of the year awards from https://www.sports-reference.com/. While these are just a few features among a vast collection of data that is available on this site, I thought that they would be among the most interesting. I would anticipate all 3 of these features to have a positive correlation \"SchoolPay\". They are also likely to be correlated with eachother, which could be problematic in a linear model, but at the same time they have some independence of eachother. For example, a school could have a really good win / loss percentage but not win the championship. Or a school could win a championship without the coach receiving a coach of the year award. I will take a closer look at this later on.\n",

I opened the following URL in a web browser, https://web3.ncaa.org/aprsearch/gsrsearch, changed the \"Sport\" selection to \"Football\", and clicked search. I then changed the \"Show Entries\" to \"All\", highlighted all of the data in the resulting table, copy and pasted that into an Excel spreadsheet, filtered on the years of 2010-2014, kept only the \"Year\", \"School\", \"GSR\", and \"FGR\" columns, and saved that as a csv file to my local drive. In the following code, I load the \"GradRates\" dataframe and merge it into the \"Coaches\" dataframe.\n",

    "Here are some of my observations from exploring the data. The \"SchoolPay\" variable ranges from 390K up to 8.3M. A lot of that variance is explained by the \"Capacity\" variable. I think that makes sense because larger stadiums bring in more revenue which bodes well for paying a coach more money. The \"Championships\", \"CoachOfTheYearAwards\", and \"OverallPct\" variables are also positively correlated with the \"SchoolPay\" variable but not as much. One thing that I was surprised about was that the \"Championships\" variable and the \"CoachOfTheYearAwards\" variable are not correlated with eachother. I was not expecting there to be a high correlation but I was atleast expecting there to be some correlation. Another thing I was surprised about was that the \"GSR\" and \"FGR\" variables did not have much of a correlation with anything other than a small correlation with the \"CoachOfTheYearAwards\". \n",

But I do not think that changing conferences is enough by itself to justify a large change in salary. The stadium size doesnt change so the revenue coming in doesnt change, atleast not right away. Overtime, I think a Big Ten school can recruit better players and thus win more games, which could lead to a bigger salary."
