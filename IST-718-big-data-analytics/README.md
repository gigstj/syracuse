IST 718: Big Data Analytics

This course offers a broad introduction to analytical processing tools and techniques for information professionals. Students develop a portfolio of resources, demonstrations, recipes and examples of various analytical techniques while growing their specialization in one or more areas of interest.

Students will learn to obtain, screen, clean, link, manipulate, analyze and display data while creating summaries, overviews, models, analyses and basic tables, histograms, trees and scattergrams. They will use Python and Apache Spark to explore classic and modern machine learning techniques (such as deep learning) within a big data context, including sentiment analysis via supervised learning, recommendation systems via unsupervised learning and predicting credit scoring via random forest machine learning.
