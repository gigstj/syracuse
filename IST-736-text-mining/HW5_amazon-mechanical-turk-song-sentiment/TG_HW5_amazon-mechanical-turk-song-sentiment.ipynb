    "In this task, I will be retrieving annotations via Amazon Mechanical Turk for the audio valence of the lyrics 77 songs. Each song will be graded by 3 different turkers on a scale of sad, neutral, or happy. I chose to pay at a rate of 10 cents per song, at a maximum of 30 minutes time, giving the turkers a total of $7.70 for completing the assignment. I felt that this was fair given that that it is about twice the amount of federal minimum wage. My only requirement was that the turkers are able to read english.\n",

While the turkers were initially found almost immediately, two of them took about 30 minutes to finish and the other one took about an hour to finish.

For example, what if one turker took 5 minutes but another turker was able to do it in 20 seconds? Furthermore, what if there was disagreement on the label? In the following section, I will explore this phenomena little bit more with hopes to flag some of the songs where this anomaly may have occurred.\n",

    "The amount of time it took the turkers to answer the questions was not consistent. Looking at the distributions, it is evident that each turker answered most of the questions relatively fast, but then some of the questions were answered very slow. It is possible that some of the songs just took longer to read than others. But then I would expect that the turkers would answer the same questions fast and the same questions slow. This was not the case, the correlation matrix shows that there is little to no correlation between any of the turkers. I wonder if the reason for the inconsistency is because the turkers were multitasking or got distracted. Next I will look at the Cohen's Kappa scores between the turkers to see how similar their answers were.\n",

    "There was not a lot of agreement between the turkers and myself. The highest kappa score was a 0.15 between turker 2 and 3. I was a little bit surprised at first to see that there was so much disagreement. I think that the ambiguity is the main reason for the discrepancies. It is difficult to decide whether a song is sad, neutral, or happy just based on the lyrics. I think part of that is because there is no way to tell what the sounds are like. This is why I picked neutral for a lot of my annotations because I could not decipher one way or another.\n",

It is paramoount that the instructions are clear and that the labels are not ambiguous. In other words, try to be objective as possible. This will leave little room for subjectivity and hopefully lead to more consistent results across annotators and a better cohens kappa score.\n",
