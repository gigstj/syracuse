when you walked by i saw a small tear in your eye lifted you up and threw you into the sun when you returned you were a little burned but you learned the secret of it all and you thought that you would burn but thatd be too easy it was only the end of the beginning cause now it can be elvis and me i thought you knew what it was that i had to do never occurred that you would just roll over i had to go not very long though you know guess for you it was an eternity and if you think youve got it now go start your crying its gonna be different when im home cause its gonna be elvis and me its just elvis and me its gonna be elvis and me just elvis and me just elvis and me and if you think youve got it now go start your crying its gonna be different when im home cause its gonna be elvis and me i wish i could fix it so that you understood if i cracked my head it would bleed like mercury the pieces of the poison raining above wont touch you now ill never let it again so if you think youve got it now continue your crying its gonna be different when im home cause its gonna be elvis and me its just elvis and me its always been elvis and me just elvis and me
