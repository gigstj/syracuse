What can I do? It's just too late to reach you
Your cigarette burnt holes all through my t-shirt
The truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

Love you for being sick and twisted
But pussy is a hell of an addiction
My heart went through a shredder
The day I learned about your baby mothers
'Cause you're a grown ass man, now you should know better
But I still run all my errands in your sweater
'Cause the truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

Alright, I'm on your radio dial!

Look up at the top of the charts, what do you see?
It's S.V.!
Hope you're ready to get down
What's the deal?
I just happen to be one of the representatives to these local styles...
Hey, look at all of these ladies crowdin' around!
Hey, they're ready to get down with the Slum Village!
Hey, they came with the Fan-Tas-Tic!
Nah, they hittin' you with the sensation!

Peace to all my people paper stackin'

For the satisfaction of climaxin'
Nasty flow on some Miss Jackson

Gotta get it where I fit in, sit in, put my business
Standing as a man in the land of the forbidden
(It's) Hard to realize 'til I saw it televised
And I made a young brother have to open his eyes
I had a little bit of this, a little bit of that
And a whole lot of money I missed
But without that whole lot of money I missed
The Kurupt couldn't rock like this
With a knot like this, I learned game baby (game baby, game baby)

You had to make an issue when I told you relax
I mean, your life it ain't passionate the way that you act
It ain't on track... Women are like that
All she really wants is a part time love affair
Tell me why do we share

Being independent and self-employed
And in the talk about sex, you just get 'nnoyed
Told you I was coming but you in-sist (ted)

I've created nothing and I'm wide awake
So can I tie my key to your electric kite?
The rooster crowed twice and you kissed me goodnight
There's too many saviors on my cross again
I know I'm never going to be a perfect man
Everyone's an oyster with their grain of sand

You're going if i have to drag your butt to church
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most
I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears

I would have loved to take her out

The fullness of my feeling
Was never made clear
But I send her my love

Nora was my girl
When I first was in a group
I can still see her to this day
Stirring chicken soup
Now she's living in Australia
Working for an auctioneer
But I send her my love
And a bang on the ear
Deborah broke my heart
And I the willing fool
I fell for her one summer
On the road to Liverpool
I thought it was forever
But it was over within the year (oh dear)
But I send her my love
And a bang on the ear
The home I made with Bella
Became a house of pain
We weathered it together
Bound by a ball and chain
It started up in Fife
It ended up in tears
But I send her my love
And a bang on the ear
Krista was a rover
From Canada she hailed
We crossed swords in San Francisco
We both lived to tell the tale
I don't know now where she is
Oh, but if I had her here
I'd give her my love
And a bang on the ear
So my woman of the hearth fire
Harbour of my soul
I watch you lightly sleeping
I sense the dream that does unfold . like gold
You to me are treasure
You to me are dear

But I cannot hide
All the emptiness inside
My fleeting heart

Once in my dreams
I rose and soared
No matter how I'm knocked around
Or beaten down
I will stand up, restored

I know your strength is what I lack
You've got my back and now that I've got yours
I have you to thank for lighting up the dark
Because you're here with me our dreams will soar free

I give you everything I have

I could never find the light to guide me through the night
And with one touch
I'd recall every memory
All too precious to not hold them all close to me
It's tempting to close your eyes and turn from the world
But it's bittersweet
Like you've somehow missed a beat
With no restart
[Chorus 2]
When every wish has overlapped
You'll realize if you carry on with every dawn
Your hesitation fades
All of your scars will disappear
I will become your sword and shield
This crossing field's the path that we select
The promise we made will last for all our days
If it's our bonds we live by I will put my
Faith in you

Can you not hear me call at all?

Got more cheese than Chuck E's

I don't like drinkin' fancy champy
I'll stick with Heineken beers

A little unladylike, what can I say?
Well oh gosh, I'm not posh, may I wear odd socks
I do what I'm doin' - Yeah!
So everybody's entitled to opinions
I open my mouth and shit, I got millions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I'll make you giggle 'til ya sick, my nose jiggles when I spit
Yeah, I do have some stories, and it's true, I want all the glory
Go on then, come on support me, I'm English - try and deport me!

Looks like God made him with something to spare

Has he got a friend? Has he got a friend for me?
He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes
He wouldn't notice me passing by
I could be in the gutter or dangling down from a tree

Doesn't mind girls who are clumsy and shy
I don't mind going with someone that I've never seen

You know, I really thought I'd never stop crying

It takes two of us

Though you swear to change
Who can tell if you do?

It takes one
To begin, but then once you've begun
It takes two of you
It's no fun
But what needs to be done
You can do
When there's two of you
If I dare
It's because I'm becoming aware of us
As a pair of us
Each accepting a share
Of what's there
[BOTH]
We've changed
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods
Who minds
What dangers?
I know we'll get past the woods
And once we're past
Let's hope the changes last
Beyond woods
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods
Just the two of us—
Beyond lies
Safe at home with our beautiful prize
Just a few of us

It takes just a bit more and we're done

We've got three
We need one

Smoke a fat blunt, and snuggle up beside you
Oh, motherfuck, there's nothing in the world that I would rather do

I'm pretty sure my old man will
And seeing his face when the wrecker hauled my freedom away

Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say
I was living like I was

It'd take a special girl to get a hold of me
But I never let one get close to me
The man upstairs must've heard her prayer
Cause I looked up, you were standin' there waitin' on me
Like you were made for me
And I knew right then and there, I'd been saved

But there's just some things that can't be said
Without a little walk on water kind of faith
And that's how I learned to pray

Didn't know why but you just knew
Someone is up there lookin' out for you

You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior

Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?

Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, 
officer
 from 
overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way

Hey look, came on so hard

Pressure becomes combustible
Wheels squeezing the arteries of haters
Plus my uncle is Quincy Jones so pardon me
I like riding a may
When it come to money boy, we got that?
Looking bad as ever, mansion in the panamerica
Why sick, I'm extravagant and clever
Will damage you, it's whatever
Grand Hustle Kings
I won't get off the mic until that thing starts sizzling
Block you like a histamine
This is really history
Watch ya old lady 'fore I slip in with this hickory
Like elmo y'all tickle me
Why I still be ripping beats
Backing fantastic, tell me that you've been listening
White on white, drop back joint

Hey what's happenin'?
It's your homeboy Lil Rob
Back with some more shit
You know I cruise my low riders
But I just can't find nothing to cruise to you know?
What happen to the good music?
All that oldies shit
Well this ones going out to everybody low riding
And need something to cruise to wacha
[Verse 1]
All you vatos take note, Lil' Rob ain't no joke
So wacha, Jump in my six-three Impala
Put down the top as I pull to the stop
Drop, roll, never can be too low
Simon I got low riders, hundred spoke wires
White wall tires four pumps jumps it higher
Than anything you've ever seen
Fucking mean fucking clean
Can't drive too fast or swerving
Slipping and dipping, that's what we call it
That's what you do when you've got Hydraulics
I sea-saw it front back side to side pancake it
We don't fake it ese we just take it
Don't try to jack it bullet holes in your jacket
From my semi-automatic
What you thought ese we ain't got no pride?
Get ready to learn how we ride on the Southside
[Hook]
I was brought up (I was brought up)
In a small neighborhood (In a small neighborhood)
Where I'm cruisin (Were I'm cruisin)
My Lowride'ss looking good (My Low rides looking good)
Said I was brought up (I was brought up)
In a small neighborhood (In a small neighborhood)
Where we go cruisin (Where we go cruisin)
And it's all to the good
Orale, check this out
[Verse 2]
Got a Bombita, 4'9 Troqita
C-H-E-V-R-O-L-E-T- you don't know?
Forty-five player for all my oldies
Forty-five double M for all them phonies
Gots corner windows and the three fifty
Pedal to the metal I can take off like quickly
Shit I could smoke 'em like my pistola
Like a Lil' Rob Rola my Troqa's the bomba
Naw it ain't painted, homes it's just primer
Black with some thirteens and a sun visor
It still looks mean though, it still looks clean though
See it on the website I'm drinking with my primo
W-w-w dot Lil' Rob dot com, I can cruise all day
And cruise all night long, from sun down til sun up
I'll cruise my troqa, I'm a lowrider, I told ya, I told ya
[Hook]
Simon!
[Verse 3]
Got a big body, F-L-double E-T double U
Double O D 1993 caddy
Extended A-Arms cause homes I play hard
Hop my carucha hopping down the boulevard
Bumping some zapp jams, oldies or rap jams
Ralphy Pagan, S.O.S. or some yap bands
I'm the outstanding that's why they can't stand me
Three wheel standing hopping with smooth landings
Four racks a four-ton the more bounce the more fun
Keeping drinks in my ride if you bring em in guaranteed to spill some
I won't stop til I catch my trunk up on fire
Keep on hopping till I pop a tire
Pass the wire, and let it be known
I'll pay the chrome bill before I pay the phone
And that's when you know, that you're a lowrider
Got pride in my ride everybody else just admires

Left and went down into town

Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside

Believing that the hungry world won't find you

You've got to believe
And I don't know, I don't know
What I believe anymore
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay
Or what I can say
To make you know
How deep it goes
Somebody turned on the dirty blues
I know you don't like the blues
'Cause the words are always the same
And they kind of remind you
Somebody turned the blues on me
Well I don't like the blues 'cause I can't see
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you
Come on down
Come on down
You've got to come lay down here
And say those things, those warm things
Right here in my ear
The times that you had that water like wine
So clean and so fine

Still fresh from the war

(Now I'm down in it)
[Verse 1]
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
Just then, a tiny little dot caught my eye
It was just about too small to see
But I watched it way too long
It was pulling me down
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
[Verse 2]
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now?
I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
Try to laugh about it now
But isn't it funny how everything works out?
""I guess the joke's on me,"" she said
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
[Verse 3]
I'll cross my heart and hope to die
But the needle's already in my eye
And all the world's weight is on my back
And I don't even know why
And what I used to think was me
Is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye
And said goodbye
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it

If I work my finger down to the bone

Something I can't buy

To get my money

I can't use her no
If she has got no cash money

I count my money

God of creation
There at the start, before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I
So will I
[Verse 2]
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I, so will I
[Bridge]
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!
Whoa!

God of salvation
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The Light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

The glove compartment
Is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I'm proposing
A swift, orderly change
Because behind its door
There's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find
Are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam
Of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life
[Verse 2]
I was searching
For some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon
Pictures I tried to forget
And that's how this idea
Was drilled into my head
'Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been
[Chorus]
But there's no blame
For how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone
It's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest
Where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

Moving, grooving, 'cause the music's booming
Macking, tryna get some action, packing, acting

Seeking a freak for the evening

Reeking from the weed I'm tokin', choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girl's at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was comin'
Sudden mood interruption, busted my girl's in the club

All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
Ita be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in

I take one step, what do I see my girl coming through the door but she don't see me

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, which motherfucker stole my flow?
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Throw them type of niggas right out my window
Blast your ass hit you with a direct blow—bahh
Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars, moving ill like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine 'cause I got the Hi-Pro Glow
You think that you can hide, you think you can lay low
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Macked out with my dreads and my Kangol
Forget the Moet, nigga, just pass the Cisco
Yo, take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through your stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect

Epic Rap Battles of History
Darth Vader vs Adolf Hitler
Begin
[Verse 1: Adolf Hitler (EpicLLOYD)]
I am Adolf Hitler! Commander of the Third Reich
Little known fact: also dope on the mic
You are Vader, with your little boots and cape
And helmet to cover up that burnt-ass face
You have the Force to move objects, I am a force truly evil
Even went back in time and turned you wack in the prequel
'Cause look at you, you’re not even a real person
I preferred you in 
Spaceballs
, the Rick Moranis version
[Verse 2: Darth Vader (Nice Peter)]
You can’t rhyme against the dark side of the Force, why even bother?
So many dudes been with your mom, who even knows if I’m your father?
You’re a pissed off little prick with a Napoleon dick
You call that a mustache? I call that Dirty Sanchez on your lip
You bitch, let me remind you who you’re messing with
Everything that you did, I’m the motherfucker who invented it
I’m the original Dark Lord, you’re like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice
My Stormtroopers make yours look like someone took a piece of shit and cloned it
[Verse 3: Adolf Hitler (EpicLLOYD)]
You stink, Vader, your style smells something sour
You need to wash up, dawg, here, step in my shower
I’ll turn all your friends against you, just my speeches breed haters
What’s your lightsaber vs a clan of all your white neighbors?
[Verse 4: Darth Vader (Nice Peter)]
Suck my robot balls
Now, take a step back and let me freeze yours off
A little carbonite bath for your goose-stepping ass
We’ll call my homeboy in Israel, see who got the last laugh
[Outro: Announcer (Nice Peter)]
Who won? Who's next? You decide

In the corner, my new Texas sweetheart
The perfect setting for an awkward first kiss
You were smiling, so my lips met your teeth
You pushed me back into my bed with your eyes
You shift your hips to help your underpants pass your thighs
I couldn't see you through the dark, but I could hear your voice
Whisper, ""never let the distance catch us""
You told me that you've known a lot of assholes
Hey, I'm an asshole but I'd never treat you wrong
No more fighting, no more whiskey or cocaine
I can change if you promise to love me

He fell and bashed his brains on the concrete
And I was thinking, ""what the fuck's so wrong with me
That'd make you sit by his bed for four long days""
And, oh, I know you said you were just friends
But I guess I'm not as stupid as you think
I've been waiting for a late night accident
Burning holes in my ceiling from my bed
Tell me - do you have a thing for the bad kid?

If the bad boys are what you want
I can show you bad, I can show you bad
If the bad boys are what you want
I can show you bad, I can show you bad
You want a boy that makes his mother cry
You want a boy that drinks, so he can sleep at night
And all his friends are at needle's edge
With seatbelt tourniquets in the passenger seat
A boy addicted to another's sheets
When every girl means no more than the last one did
Read the stories on my hands
And my broken bones
And the scars on my legs

I can show you bad, I can show you bad
If the bad boys are what you want

I been going through it

Back all against the wall
Trying hard not to fall
All I wanted was to ball
I been going through it all
Back all against the wall
I only get one call
Who the fuck do I call?

I ain't got no friends
All I got is my fam
LaFontaine Shit
Me and Sloan til the end
Fuck all these other niggas
I don't wanna do a song with ya
Unless you talking about some guala
In that case I might hit ya
I think I've been too nice
But this is where the shit ends
Pussy boy I ain't your nigga
And bitch I ain't your fucking man
I don't fuck with nobody
I never fuck with nobody
You can ask anybody
If they said I did then they lying
Don't talk about me like you know me
I see that all these niggas phony
And all these hoes need to keep the mamba out they mouth
Unless they finna blow me
All of this could've been avoided
But a nigga really had to snap
Cause I been going through it all
And ain't nobody have my back
Where the fuck was y'all at
When young mamba went down
Soon as I'm back up
Everybody wanna come around
But I been going through it now
This shit is really still the same
So until a nigga counting hundreds
I ain't playing no more games
I been going through it all
Mix the drugs with the alcohol
Just for I can get away
But the shit don't last long
I always gotta come back
Right back to where I'm at
I swear that that's the worst part
Cause then a nigga relapse
I been going through it all
I been having these thoughts
Whenever I get lost
Would it be better if I'm gone
I thought I had it figured out
But then it all came clearer
Only thing that kept me going
Was looking in the fucking mirror
I'm just too damn pretty
I know your bitch agree with me
The world would be fucked up
If my face wasn't all in it
Plus I gotta get rich
Cause I'm really that nigga
I'm Jordan you Pippen
I wanna ball no scrimmage
Soon as shit take off
New ice, new car
I'ma flex so hard
I'm really trynna hurt your heart
Bitch what the fuck you thought
What you thought that I forgot
Just cuz I be off the drugs
Don't think a nigga went dumb
I been going through it all
That's why I'm going so hard
You did this shit to yourselves
I swear it's not my fault
I know I'm really 'bout to blow
And I ain't never been wrong
Young mamba finna glow
I gotta prove these bitches wrong
I don't do this shit for fun
Bitch I'm really trying to stunt
So I can pull up on my ex
And make the hoe feel dumb
I'm already getting paid
Just off the features and the hooks
But a nigga never satisfied
Even if that's how it look
I always been a greedy bitch
Always been a pretty bitch
And I don't care how sad I get
I'll always be with the shits
Don't let me find out you a lick
Still run up in your crib
Still out here taking risks
Do whatever for the chips

Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss,
 a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side

And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?

The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty
[Verse 1]
Well, I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no, nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song
Just want to boogie-woogie all night long
Yeah, boogie
I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million
And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a Mamma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band, doin' drinking with the boys
She's working 9-to-5
(She knows her place, that woman)
Just you wait
One of these days, see me driving 'round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sunroof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out, ""Mom, look at me""
In my rock 'n' roll voice
[Chorus]
No, it ain’t no fun, yeah
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain’t no fun
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Do you believe me?
It ain't no fun, no
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
It ain’t no fun, (I don't care what they say)
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain’t no fun, and you know it
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire

You've got lunch with your sister tomorrow
So we can't be up late
You don't mind if I sleep in
But then I've gotta pack my things
So I stacked a Bukowski novel on a Blacklisted LP
And this time what it looked like was just what it proved to be
You said you needed a stiff drink to take your mind off things
[Chorus]
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
[Verse 2]
I've been avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
Because I just can't handle seeing you today
You made this house into a home
Now, I'm a stranger on my street
And as I turned to leave
I caught myself in the mirror to see I aged a year this week
I left a note up on your bed that said
""Hey, thanks again for everything you did""
[Chorus]
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline

When John introduced ""Woke Up New"" in St. Augustine
I knew I wasn't alone
When I woke up here without you
There was nothing to do but pack up and go home

Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes

The Shaolin Soldiers,

Killa Beez all over your fuckin' planet

'Cause the ho didn't win,

And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone!
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones
The GZA, one who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with full metal jackets

No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack-ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped-up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you, kid
'Cause I don't know you, therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants? Ahh, human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time, come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How you sound, B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ, the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs, I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike 'em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is
[Verse 2: Daz]
I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Aiyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, ""If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game""
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
(Pump pump!) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
6 feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is
[Hook: The D.O.C.]
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
I won't leave you
 until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends,
 
you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well
[Hook: The D.O.C. & 
Snoop Dogg

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!

[Verse 4: RBX]
Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets!
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally rough-neck!
Now everybody scream, 'nough respect to the X
'Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living

""Roxanne's Revenge""
 by Roxanne Shanté]
I asked you a question
I wanna know why
I wanna know why
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
[Verse 1]
I heard that you heard
That I was writing songs about you
That I was bad mouthing your name
In some shitty bar somewhere
You know how I love
These biased, one-sided conversations
So let's discuss the whos, the whys, the whens, the hows, the wheres
But who really cares
If it was all in my mind
If it was all in my mind
To begin with
If it was all in my mind
If it was all in my mind
To begin with
[Verse 2]
And I remember her bent over
And knowing that it was the last time
You know the end is near
If she only lets you fuck at night
And when she finally came even though she faked it
It was much appreciated
At least she had the decency
To try to make a sound she thought I'd like
But it's alright
Cause it was all in my mind
Cause it was all in my mind
To begin with
Cause it was all in my mind
Cause it was all in my mind
To begin with

Yeah I heard your song
But I wasn't impressed
So you got your feelings hurt
Now you're feeling depressed
Just because we had sex and it didn't last
Now you want revenge
You want to put me on blast
Don't make me laugh
Remember all the girls you played
And all the lies you told back in the day to get laid
An excuse for Suze
You got a story for Lori
And all those other girls you only called when you were horny
So yeah, it's nothing that you didn't do first
The only difference is that you probably did it worse
So look at the big bad soldier
Declaring holy war on every girl who didn't mean to fuck him over
But karma's a bitch
For hypocrites who kiss and tell
And talk shit about girls who only wished him well
So if you wanna chat
Just stick to the facts
And get at me
From Russia with love

Are you having any fun? (Are you having any fun?)

Check it, yo, if you ain't having fun, whatchu do it for?
Quit your job, leave your wife, tell your kids you went on tour
You went out to get them snacks, ice cream and some chocolate fudge
You the one they love, so if you disappear, they'll hold a grudge
Showing up at graduation, telling them you're proud they made it
Then it's back to your vacation,
 
bumping Californication
In your station wagon that you borrowed from your older neighbors
Left a note that you would take it (You kids get back here!)
Living life without responsibility, sorta sounds a deal to me
Changed my name to cavity cause everybody filling me
Heard some people say I ain't a real MC
Might become a chef the way these motherfuckers grilling me
Meanwhile I got every Will Smith CD
And the first two seasons of Felicity
Rapping's like a gift to me
Literally I hit em with the Pun like, 'Yeah Baby Baby'
Are you having any fun?

Are you having any fun?

Could've had it all, but then you lost it (Oh)

Yeah, first of the month comes, I ain't excited for it
Baby diapers, baby Jordans, you know I'm providing for it
Know I said I had a baby, baby, but that's premature
No one's pregnant yet, but they might be once they hear this verse
My life's a movie, Imma be the one who's cast in it
Got so many girls, it'd be an Ashton flick
Might upset the pacifists, but fact is I am really quite compassionate
Like when it comes to smoking blunts, you know I'm always ashin' it
Plus, I'm killing it with older women like The Graduate
I could see you in my future, girl, could you imagine it?
You the type to type a lot and call yourself an activist
I'm the type to overthink it all, I'm such an analyst
Everyone agrees, you so attractive, it's unanimous
I'll do anything you want, babe, except abstinence
Take a yoga class and shit, maybe buy you brunch

[Chorus]
I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection
Spy (Oh yeah) in the house of love (Look it here)
[Verse 2]
I saw, yes I did, everything that pleased her
I recorded every movement
And plotted how to seize her
I used a tiny camera
I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her
And sat around and squeezed her
[Chorus]
I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection

I'll read your mail (I'll read your mail)
I'll tap your phone (I'll tap your phone)
I'm on your trail
You're never alone
One day you'll slip up
And leave a lip print on a coffee cup
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah oh yeah)
I'm a spy, yeah, but I just can't help myself
Spy in the house of love
Spy (Oh baby) in the house of love
Oh I can't go now
[Verse 3]
I used a tiny camera
I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her
And sat around and squeezed her

I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love

I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love

Brought my BB gun to school in the fifth grade

I just bought a PS4, but I don't play
And my nigga slidin' right behind me with the K
If I give you somethin', nigga you better say thanks
And I remember eatin' peanut butter treats
I ain't hit my lady in a couple days
You don't know what I had to go through
You don't know what I had to go do
In the studio, you know I keep the Pro Tools

And even though you gone, I keep the commissary straight
Slime in the Tahoe ridin' with that SK
No Wells Fargo, nigga, I got big bank
I be rappin' 'bout it, 'cause I'm livin' this way
Top nigga, I been put up in a fish tank
Took that bitch to Chik-Fil-A, she said she wanna steak
They had to let me outta jail for my birthday
This ain't no water gun but when I see you I'ma spray
Mine a sniper, quick to shoot, I fuck with Lil Tay
And this money doin' somethin' to my membrane

Forgive me for what I have done
I've never felt the need to confess
This war has gone on much longer
Than any of us would have guessed
I've heard the names that they call me
Some sting and some can't help but ring true
I have to live with what I've done
And find the strength to continue
Tell me why I'm the one that they fear
And for him they cheer

I cheated, the lies that I told
Is for a future that I have seen
The death, the lives that I stole
The end has to justify the means

It filled too quickly with his rage
I think that I heard

Bought Giuseppe, nigga, just to kick it
Bought a hundred pounds, then I flipped 'em
Poured the eight and then I start sippin'
Took a whole P and started burnin'
Took a whole brick and then I served it
I started off with a plan
Then turned myself to the man
Really, I ain't have a helpin' hand
Just blew your favorite rapper advance
Just had to choke a little nigga out
'Cause the little nigga ran his mouth
Just had to spray up a nigga house
'Cause he ran off with an ounce

Got a a thousand P's in the loft

On the Rorschach sheets where we make love

But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in ""I-told-you-so"" voice:
""It’s just how we expected""

Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared

That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

Don't give into despair

Silence ringing inside my head

Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock
[Verse 1]
Now as I get to 
school
 I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""
[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""
Recess!
[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

Well the night that Joe Bob found out that Kenny Dean was sneakin' around with June
He caught Bobby Lee in the band in the middle of an old Hank William's tune
And Bobby Lee cried out your cheatin' heart
That was just the spark it took
And when the fighting got started
Everybody took part and that whole damn building shook
'Til the sheriff came out and he stomped about
Hauled everybody to jail
When the judge saw the blood and the chewed up ears
He turned a whiter shade of pale
He said good ""God ya'll what's happened here
Somebody started World War III""
Kenny Dean just grinned the best he could and said
""Your Honor it seems to me like it was just another""
[Chorus]
Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
They was drinking and dancing the music of Bobby Lee and the Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee
Lord if you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee",6.0,8.082394599998224

Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up even to a, total stranger
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them
Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucka
To pay a fee for pus-sy but not - me, motherfuckahHHH
I move quick with my pool stick, Slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly
But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it
And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line, but with that I gotta bring the pain
Now, I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done, when it comes to your pride & your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, cause I gots me a rep to protect
Now, I mights be known for this, and maybe recognized for that
But they be high-beamin me; and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be
'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power, fuck them freaks, blunts and beers

But I cain't help it.. can't stay witchu girl cause I can't tell if it's
Official, or just another ritual
It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin for me to, get a hoe
I know it sounds, pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a P-F-L, 'til I'm a old nigga
'Cause I never spend my life with groupies, or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shakin' naked, tryna' make it
If you spendin all his money take it bitch you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

So plant yourself a gallows tree
Bury your head so you won't see

Hide yourself up inside

Are we flakes of empty dust
Spinning on a ball of rust?
Maybe
But the light is ours to see
You had eyes, but sewed them shut
But that feeling in your gut won't fade
Is it all a tragedy?
Are we flashes in a rut
Going in and out of luck?
Maybe
But the answers will not change
Even when they're covered up
All these questions in your gut won't fade

There are monsters in the sky
There are demons in the sea

Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 2]
If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide
If I'd-a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would’ve died
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me
[Verse 3]
Now the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom
I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously
Somebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me
[Verse 4]
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I’d just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me
[Verse 5]
Now I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
I would’ve followed you in the door, but I didn’t have a ticket stub
So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me
[Verse 6]
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
You looked a little burned out my friend, I thought it might be up to me
[Verse 7]
I met somebody face to face, I had to remove my hat
She’s everything I need and love, but I can’t be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth, of how sweet life can be
But she ain’t goin' to make a move, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 8]
Now we heard the Sermon on the Mount, and I knew it was too complex
It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty
Somebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 9]
Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Now I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company
You ain’t goin' to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 10]
There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She’s the one you been wondering about, but there’s really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 11]
So go on boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me
[Verse 12]
If we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me",1.0,1.650062100001378

That's the best day of your life
[Verse 1]
Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm too high to get the phone
Found a girl that loves me so I told her she should go
I don't know what God is but he's telling me to slow
Bottle after bottle, I think I'm losing control
[Pre-Chorus]
Writing, 
coasting, down the five
All I need is one more night
[Chorus]
If we ain't way up in the club then we're somewhere up in the hills
If we ain't looking like we drunk it's 'cause we've been poppin' 'em pills
She ain't saying she's in love but she loved the way that it feels
She loved the way that it feels, I loved that way that it feels
If we ain't somewhere in the club then we're somewhere up in the hills
If we ain't looking like we drunk it's 'cause we've been poppin' 'em pills
She ain't saying she's in love but she loved the way that it feels
She loved the way that it feels, I loved that way that it feels
[Verse 2]
How much can I take of this until I finally break?
I just hope I get a chance to learn from my mistakes
I feel like a star I might just fuck in outer space
Every night's a movie, I'm losing track of the days
[Pre-Chorus]
Writing, coasting, down the five
All I need is one more night
[Chorus]
If we ain't way up in the club then we're somewhere up in the hills
If we ain't looking like we drunk it's 'cause we've been poppin' 'em pills

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?
Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside
You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""
[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no
[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?
[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price

And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Verse 1]
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Bridge]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again
[Verse 2]
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Bridge]
Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand
[Verse 3]
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance?
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Verse 4]
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Verse 5]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",2.0,2.842639699996653

This cigarette, it could seduce
A nation with its smoke
Crawling down my tired throat
Scratches part of me that's purring
Softly stirring
I'm a captain of industry, smoking famously
Feet up on the windowsill
Looking at all these trees I feel affinity with
Everything so soft and still
Budding at my fingertips
Touching you, I start to bloom
Alive with trains and passing ships
Soft and sweet along your lips now
I go ""oh wow""

Above deep shade coloured with the calls of cuckoos
The ring of coppersmith's hammer
High in the hiss of the wind
Wind filled with spirits
And bright with the jangle of horse bells

It's morning
Over the scratched-up soil, scorched-earth wasted
Long shadows lead women bearing water
I watch the sway of skirts
Think of moist spice forests—
Still midnight whispers at my ear

Sharp against spring snow

In Japanese temple—
There was a single orange blossom
At the wrong time of year—

It was gone

I only walk where the bricks are made of gold
My mind and body are the only things I've sold
I need a little money 'cause I'm getting old

And I don't mean the couple who went up the hill
I just mean a couple o' lovers that live next door
And they’re always battlin' and I'm tryin' to keep the score
They’re always
Pettin' and pokin' and
Jabbin' and jokin' and
Cuein' and crackin' and
Wooin' and wackin'
They keep neckin' and knockin'
Singin' and sockin' an'
Squawkin' and squeezin' an'
Burnin' and freezin'
Why, he holds her hands as long as he's able
But when he lets go, she bops him with a table
They start right in
Pattin' and pinchin' and
Cloudin' and clinchin'
They're enjoying themselves, havin' a good time
Now Reverend Green thought he'd call one day
On this nicely newly weds across the way
But just as the pastor knocked on the door
A straight right connected; ""Mop,"" he hit the floor
They was pettin' and poppin' and
Bangin' and boppin'
Cooin' and kissin' and
Hittin' and missin'
They kept on groovin' and grievin' and
Lovin' and leavin'
Kickin' and cacklin' and
Ticklin' and tacklin'
Now one night a neighbor tried some intervention
But one short jab knocked out his good intention
They started right in, stewin' and stabbin' and
Jivin' and jabbin'
Havin' a good time
Now once a lion escaped from a circus train
He strayed in Jack and Jill's domain
Just then they got in a towerin' rage
Lion took one look and jumped back in his cage
They started in swattin' and swingin' and
Pottin' and playin'
Stompin' and stabbin' and
Groovin' and grabbin'
They kept dancin' and duckin'
Trippin' and truckin'
Plottin' and pleadin' and
Bangin' and bleedin'
Her mother said, ""I'll go right In there and fetch her""
But mom came out riding on a stretcher
They started right in
Hittin' and holdin'
Faintin' and foldin'
They was enjoying themselves, havin' a good time
Now once a reporter called on the wife
Just to gather some data on her hectic life
She told him she'd never found time for books
She's always busy duckin' left hooks
They was always swattin' and swingin' and
Sockin' and singin' and
Cuttin' and cuddlin' and
Messin' and muddlin' they kept on
Fondlin' and fussin' and
Kissin' and cussin' and
Tappin' and teasin' and
Squattin' and squeezin'
Once a voice called out, ""Stop! I'm the law""
But all he stopped was a haymaker to the jaw
They started in jivin' and jumpin' and trobbin' and thumpin'
They was enjoying themselves
You see they were in love
Ain't married life wonderful?

I wish that I cold be an Indian
On a painted pony so fast
No one could ever catch me
I get caught up in my past
I'd ride across many rivers
Use many moons to tell the times
Then I'd tell all the young warriors
Many moons ago this was mine, all mine

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a pirate
I'd sail the ocean blue
Way before the big liners
Started sailing them too
I'd bury most of my treasures
So I would leave a big hole
And the only real sense of pleasure that I'd get
Is I'd sail free of my soul

Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a slave
It doesn't matter what kind
I'd sing a song for fallen angels
Try and be free in my mind
Then when no one wasn't lookin'
Well I'd drop my harvest plow
I'd find my own contemporaries
And wipe the shame from their brow

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be an outlaw
Runnin' from the law sometimes
No vigilante against the seasons
But I can't help but read why
I'd always keep my revolver
Steady and fast at my side and
I'd rob a train bound for glory
'Cause I thought I needed a ride

Same ol' river

Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, 
plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

[Verse 1]
I like the snares loud enough to make your eyes blink from it
Only male with the Holy Grail, drink from it
I keep an eye on heaven and a ear to the street
And spread a thick layer of blood, sweat and tears on the beats
My brain rest upon the hip-hop lexicon
That I acquired in the decade of work that people slept upon
I don't rap, I recite the prayers of the inner soul
Of the slave ships' human cargo
Seemingly meaningless rappers flood the market
With shit that make me pace in my room until I rip the carpet
I'm fit to start up this next millennium
Swingin the grappling hook at cackling crooks to finish em
The city dweller sendin telegrams from Neverland
The better man, kind now, kindly join the caravan
We're like a rock band that pack contraband
And won't hesitate to stomp a man into the rocks and sand
Brother Ali, and if you haven't heard about me
I'm flyin just beneath your radar so y'all can doubt me
Stay on the sonar with crowbars to open minds
There's a ladder you're supposed to climb
Approach a Rhymesayer with a Buggsy Siegel sized ego
You gon' get yourself snatched out the sky, you know 
the steelo
By now, where, what, why and how
We start the revolution real time, right now

Yes, leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none

The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall, my inner light shall..
[Verse 2]
I rhyme for cats up in the harbor lights
Prayin they don't starve tonight
And stay positive in the face of a harder life
My chorus light the torch for those on whom the sun set
Verses meant to speak for the voiceless
So let us never be dismayed or afraid
The ground we're walkin on is stained
With the blood of those before us who came
Soldiers in this freedom movement are too numerous to name
Cause the human soul yearns to be free, it's all the same
I rhyme for runaways prayin that they see another day
You gotta make it through the winter to feel some summer days
It's for my natives, it's history in the way their hair is braided
Elephants never forget, that's how they say it
Tell my man [Name] in prison keep grinnin because he's innocent
And tell him that the tests we get are heaven-sent
Listen, I rap for the ones that Johnny Cash wore, the black, for
Black and white women that were turned to crackhores
And I empty everything in the bank to give for it
I empty all the days of my life to live for it
And I empty all the blood in my veins to fight for it
So I empty all the ink in this pen to write for it

Yes, leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall cast shadows on the sun
Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none

[Verse 3]
I glance in the sky and see the same cloud configuration
That Nat Turner saw the day they hanged him
Resisted in the face of adversity with a fist and it was raised
One finger extended, meaning Allah be praised
Spent days in Heaven's embassy
On Qu'ran pages Allah explains this legacy
Angels doubted Adam, Jacob's brothers clapped him
And ancient Pharaohs were too brutal to fathom
If all the earth's oceans were ink and the trees were pens
You could never write the knowledge of God, it never ends
And I know it feels like the whip wounds will never mend
But it's the way of makin the oppressed prevalent men
We standin with humanity at destiny's door
Chanting the war cry, it goes, ""Never no more""
So if y'all tryina talk about the horrors you see
Feel free to tell your stories through me
[Hook]
Yes, leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none

Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none

She's undercover from the dawns advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained
Miami sky
It's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington ...
Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty--
In her ballrooms heads of state--
In her bedrooms rented girls--
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty ...
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington ...
Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream
She has awake
Checked into Miami Royal
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington ...

Money in the mansion, yayo in another spot
Guns in the attic, mama help me put 'em up
She'll pull 'em down, tell you quick to him 'em up
Load a hundred rounds, bring it back she'll fill it up

He count chips but that trick may have got 'em flip

They announced it in the lobby what had just gone on
He drove up from Birmingham back to the family's farm
Thought he'd get him a deferment there's was much work to be done
He was a family man, even in those days
But Uncle Sam decided he was needed anyway
In the South Pacific over half a world away
He believed in God and Country, things was just that way
Just that way…..
When I was just a kid I spent every weekend
On the farm that he grew up on so I guess so did I
And we'd stay up watching movies on the black and white TV
We watched ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" starring John Wayne
Every year in June George A. goes to a reunion
Of the men that he served with and their wives and kids and grandkids
My Great Uncle used to take me and I'd watch them recollect
About some things that I could not comprehend
And I thought about that movie, asked if it was that way
He just shook his head and smiled at me in such a loving way
As he thought about some friends he will never see again
He said ""I never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima""
Most of those men are gone now but he goes still every year
And George A's still doing fine, especially for his years
He's still living on that homestead in the house that he was born in
And I sure wish I could go see him today
He never drove a new car though he could easily afford it
He'd just buy one for the family and take whatever no one wanted
He said a shiny car didn't mean much after all the things he'd seen
George A. never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima",1.0,2.579867500000546

Chopping heads off with madame guillotine
Even the French know better than to fuck with me

I'm in the UK (Why?), I've got a show to do

I'm sipping Saronno with this chick named Ramona
She wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah
Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her

Keepin' calm, snatch the cheese from his hand
Thinkin' about a getaway route, I jacked him for a van
Jumped into the thang, slammed the door, hit the gas

Looked into the rear, it was his prejudice-ass wife…
Balled up on the seats cryin', ""Please don't take my life""
I grabbed her by her hair – ""Hush, bitch, don't speak""
And doin' about 110, then released her into the streets
I'm pushin' a van, I made my move toward Motel 6…
To rob a trick who had got himself hooked up with a bitch…
Who had only one intention – to pinch him, was bein' paid
The bitch went down with me and the buster was gettin' played
My mind started thinkin' the bitch is only for gankin'
The shit started stankin' as soon as I started drankin'
The first spirit told me to pay her and let her go
The devil told me, ""How in the fuck can you trust a ho?""
My hands started shakin' and mentally, I was breakin'
My hunger for the thrill of a kill begun achin'
I'm takin' all the money, proceedin' to bust a rapin'
Swiss army knife tight on the wrist and I started tapin'…
Her mouth up, pullin' the couch up and gushing
A knife held to her neck through the back of the seat cushion
I'm takin' the loot, then breakin' her loose from the scenery
Checkin' my tracks, constantly watchin' my back
What does it mean to be…
Totally paranoid, thinkin' my past gonna catch up with my ass?
Livin' my life so fast, people wonderin' how do I usually last
Don't question me unless you down on my level…

[Verse 2: 8Ball]
Clappin' in my undercover bucket, chiefin hay
Thinkin' about the fat liquor nigga hit for yesterday
Now, finally the horrors of my hustle will not haunt me
No more will I have to jack these niggas…
And leave them bodies in the street
Driftin' to another place, halfway through my blunt
A whole Ninquén and a fifth of gin to get shit crunk
No dirt on my mind until I seen him
$100,000 Benz with gold-tone rims
I said no more will I ever take another man's shit…
Until I seen that Rolex when he hit that cigarette
Instinctively, I start to follow him and make my scheme
At the same time, wonderin' why do I do these things
Could there be a force stronger than our ones we know?
Unconsciously controllin' things we do and how shit go
Now I'm reachin' for my Glock, my only tooler
Hopin' this time I don't even have to use her
At the same time, this nigga felt like eatin' Taco Bell
At the same time, he did not know he 'bout to catch hell
Pulled up on the lot a bit fast, I'm a little anxious
Ready to get my serve on like a motherfuckin' waitress
He must've noticed me, then balled out the lot fast
But I can't let him pass with them out-of-state tags
I hit the gas to the floor and made them dogs holler
Tinted windows hidin' me inside my '78 Impala
Now I'm twisted, angry, blood boilin' like some coffee
Hearin' voices that go, ""Let him go and don't be foolish""
But there's a louder voice drownin' out my good intentions…
Screamin', yellin', forcin' me to complete my mission
Listen, temptation put me in this situation
But somethin' good is the reason for my hesitation
In the end, I took his car, his jewels and his life
The devil made me do it
[Hook: MJG]
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it

Gotta dig my own grave just to learn my lesson

I'm a playa
I'm a playa, I'm a playa
Oh, oh, oh, I'm a playa
(Yeah, Tech- Tech- Tech Nina is a playa)
[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If you see me looking clean cut
Matching from head to toe, dipping with a mean strut
Throwing and blowing green stuff
Hella creamed up with the bling cuff
Ain't no wicked, we can kick it if you blue or beamed up
If you see me step off in the club or with some pros
With about six of 'em cut, no longer waiting to be chosen
If you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dipping to Davy's
Right when the clubber close
If you see me on the grind gettin' mine
If you bust in a room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes, rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line
If I'm rollin on dubs, if it's K-town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them haters givin' me mugs
Ladies givin' me hugs
Know it ain't no rocket science, it's because

I'm a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
I'm gettin' money from these dummies, flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars
I'm a playa when I don't or when I drop dollars
Them Rottweilers
She don't want no softie sayin' he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetratin' nine-to-fiver tryin' to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it crunk
No she don't
That's how it goes so my homie Kaliko, tell 'em what she want
[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
She want a playa, not thugs on dubs
We be rolling them 22's and 3's, popping ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute
Kaliko knock boots, gots lots to shoot
And I'm pullin' out the latex and givin' it to who's next
I'm pullin', pull a brunette with unforgettable sex
She's oohin' oohin' new sweat and I ain't tellin who's wet
And I ain't gettin' loose yet, so who's next for group sex

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
(Listen closely, this is something you might not know)
Never ever tell your love where else you get your love
Move in groups, no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies, throw away your ticket stub
If you sexin', learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water, don't put no soap on your washcloth
That way when you get home
No questions, you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap 'cause it will leave a scent
Don't tell a number 2 that she's your one and only
'Cause if she knows we're easy to go her own way
If you takin' chickens to your secret home, hey
Always go the back way to confuse 'em, just go the long way
To all my ladies if you playin' throw your hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw your grands up
This is forever baby, havin' clever thangs

Alright, so this is a song about anyone, it could be anyone
You're just doing your own thing and someone comes out the blue, they're like:
""Alright, whataya saying?""
""Yeah, can I take your digits?'
And you're like, ""No, not in a million years, you're nasty, please leave me alone.""
[Verse 1]
Cut to the pub on a lad's night out
Man at the bar, 'cause it was his shout
Clocks this bird and she looked okay
She caught him looking and walked his way
""Alright, darlin', you gonna buy us a drink then?""
""Er, no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend...""
She's got no taste, hand on his waist
Tries to pull away, but her lip's on his face
""If you insist, I'll have a White Wine Spritzer""
""Sorry, love, but you ain't a pretty picture""
[Chorus]
Can't knock 'em out, can't walk away
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say ('Er, sorry, yeah, but nah')
""Just get out my face, just leave me alone
And, no, you can't have my number (why?), 'cause I lost my phone""
[Post-Chorus]
'Oh, yeah, actually yeah, I'm - I'm pregnant
Um, yeah, I'm having a baby in like six months and uh, yeah, yeah...'
[Verse 2]
I recognize this guy's way of thinking
As he walks over, her face starts sinking
She's like, ""Ah, here we go""
It's a routine check that she already knows
She's thinkin', ""They're all the same""
""Yeah, you alright, baby? You look alright still
Yeah, what's your name?""
She looks in her bag, takes out a fag
Tries to get away from the guy on a blag
Can't find a light - ""Here, use mine""
""You see, the thing is I just don't have the time""
[Chorus]
Can't knock 'em out (Can't knock 'em out)
You can't walk away (You can't walk away)
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say ('Er, I'm really sorry, but not this time, mate')
""Just get out my face, just leave me alone
And, no, you can't have my number, 'cause I lost my phone""
[Bridge]
Go away now, let me go
Are you stupid, or just a little slow?
Go away now, I've made myself clear (I don't think so)
""Nah, it's not gonna happen, not in a million years!""
[Chorus]
Can't knock 'em out (Can't knock 'em out)
You can't walk away (You can't walk away)
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say ('Er...')
""Just get out my face, just leave me alone
And, no, you can't have my number, 'cause I lost my phone""
[Chorus]
Can't knock 'em out
You can't walk away
Try desperately to think of the ('Uh, actually, I'm getting married next week') politest way to say
""Just get out my face, just leave me alone ('No, no, seriously')
And, no, you can't have my number, 'cause I lost my phone""

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely - so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend
But I predicted this endin, back in the day
Cuz I had visions of bad decisions knew niggas would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still will a nigga lose?
No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain;
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail - you play 'em wrong then you fail
It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved - everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw
And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We supposed to be been tighter, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin the devil get in, should’ve pinned
He was pretending to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass
Slither slick, the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died
All of my niggas came to get dressed
And thanks for comin, I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin
But I'm still rappin get it all off my chest
So I came back to the action
When the bird was flyin, low, and laughin
Family bashin 'til it just happened
Then Wally passed - and he asked me, ""Wasn't it tragic?""
Louie askin me if he'll ever come back so hard
We tell the truth, no use in beatin around the bush
Baby I'm sorry.. it's alllll in the game
Throwin up blood - fuck it Layz'
Let's sign our life awayyy
[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Now see me? I ain't givin up a motherfuckin thang
It's hard to come by - and I ain't no bitch nigga
Shit been in some robberies and walkbys
And you don't want that; neither do I
But I will, I will - cause I'm a hustler, hustler
High 'til I die, I'm gon' get mine
Even if it mean murder, gettin caught, fuck it let me fry
Know it's hectic, niggas start shit nowadays..
But I'm a hustler just like you, don't bring that shit my way

My niggas'll pop with the pistols, and snap out the holsters
And cover a snitch all wet
Why the fuck could not he write me S-E-T for the second sincerely
We baggin 'em up rollin niggas and throwin 'em in the wasteland
Soldier, told ya nigga we gone have our time
Like daughters in heaven don't tell him, on his knee

Niggas pick up another, then they run

[Verse 1]
Did a lot of dirt myself, dirty
Thirty on me, shoot 'em like Steph Curry
Shells get to raining, gettin’ wet up, huh?
Fall and your ass won't get up, nah
Bitch, I get busy with choppers and Glizzies
I'm ridin’ through the city, this Glock got no safety
Keep that bitch with me so please do not tempt me
I squeeze 'til it's empty, you thinkin', you crazy
Bad bitch from another country, foreign
Slam dunk all on the pussy, scoring
Nigga, I'm on to the next, she boring
Finna pull up on her friend, who's goin'?
Bands on me, money won't fold, damn
Leprechaun, where is me gold bands?
Can’t catch the drip, you got no hands
I ain’t got opps, I got all fans
I be slidin' on niggas, straight patchin’ them
You ain't wanna die, why you lack with them?
Hoppin' up out of them Astro vans
Caught your ass, boy, you can't hide from ’em
We dangerous, Tooka, man, smoke 'em like angel dust
Boy, you ain't gang, you a stain, you can't hang with us
Glizzies on every gang member that came wit us
Aim and just spray at them niggas that ain't wit us
[Chorus]
How you gon' war with a god, a beast?
You don't need guns, you need heart, you weak
Boy, we would dust yo' ass off, sweepin'
You don't want smoke on my squad, you tweakin'
Tell them niggas they don't wanna war wit us (Nah)
They don't wanna war wit us, nah
Tell them niggas they don't wanna war wit us
Boy, we some monsters, savages, and warriors
Tell them niggas they don't wanna war wit us (Nah)
They don't wanna war wit us, nah
Tell them niggas they don't wanna war wit us
Boy, we some monsters, savages, and warriors
[Verse 2]
Whole lotta wild ass shorties, babies
Thirty-five stuffed in a forty, KD
Nah, they don't need no aim, say what?
Hitting niggas up close range, layups
Two hands, I'm rocking the metal
I'm hot like the devil, I bury your block like a shovel
Hit your ass all in your neck, now your head on your chest
Look like Olympic gold medals (Hahaha)
Switchin' gears, swervin' through traffic, stop us
I can switch gears on my ratchet, choppa
Boy, when we roll up we bustin', blocka
Knock all that meat out your fuckin' taco
Hollow tips spinning like cyclones
FaceTime a nigga like iPhone
Put a pretty opp bitch in a morgue, huh
Call that bitch drop dead gorgeous, damn
I'm heartless, bitch, you can call me the Tin Man
Going against me is like crawling through quicksand
Draco be sparkin' and bargin' through bricks, man
Some call me grandson, some call me hitman
(Bitch) Bitch, some call me hitman
(Bitch) Bitch, some call me hitman
Some call me grandson

My lips crack with every grin

[Verse 1: Black C]
Black C stepping through kicking ass and
And all you punk muthafuckas, I hate you with a passion
‘Cause you play with a small deck
And for the test, your ass get checked
Niggas in the SF see ya
10 percent love me, 90 percent hate me
But that’s a O-muthafuckin-K
And to the 10 percent that love is strapped with an AK
It’s a jack when I’m in black
And if you got a crack sack, your ass getting jacked for that
And it’s a shame ‘cause I do this thang
But it’s the way you gotta be in the muthafuckin’ dope game
And you can’t be soft, ‘cause if you’re soft
You’ll get tossed, I’m not taking no loss
Niggas wanna roll through muggin’
You got a flex on your chest so let’s start sluggin’
In the muthafuckin’ street
10 brothers, a ghetto boxer, and a nigga couldn’t fuck with me
Bink bink to the chin
A right, left, uppercut, now his ass got broke in
The nigga got laid out
Two times to the jaw and his ass got played out
Tryna slug with me
But his ass shoulda known that I ain’t no joke, G
(“I ain’t no joke”)
[Verse 2: Mr. Cee]
Now wash me down, comin’ uno, dos to the three
It’s Mr. Cee from the SFC
But you don’t really hear me though
So you got beat down when you rolled through Frisco
Thinking it was cool, you’re nothin’ but a fool
So it’s time for the fool to get schooled
But don’t let that be a setback
At least you didn’t get jacked with a chrome plated get
No type of role model to look to
I tried Magic Johnson and now he’s through
That’s why I don’t care if you die
Tryin’ to be fly, in the 415
And when it comes to drama, we come equipped
So put a gun in my hand and it sho’ won’t slip
But better yet fit, like a key to a lock
Like a bullet to a Glock
Killin’ nonstop
I’m still standing so I guess it was a donut just got popped
So quit playing with this rope before you tie your neck in a noose
And you can’t get loose
I’m just one of them young locs
Word to the serious tip, this nigga ain’t no joke
(“I ain’t no joke”)
[Verse 3: Black C]
Back on the muthafuckin’ track
Black C kickin’ facts while bitches on the bozack
But it ain’t no thang to me
‘Cause in SFC, we always roll deep
(Chris, how deep?) Deeper than that fat ass bitch
And she can suck my muthafuckin’ dick
And all you gangstas, prankstas, even big bankstas
Mashin’ through my hood, I should spank ya
You got a problem with that?
I see your pockets is fat so I think I should jack
So it’s time to put my mask on
Get my 9-double-M, and then I get my blast on
I’m not taking no shorts
If you’re not a big dog, stay your puppy ass on the porch
‘Cause most niggas wanna try me
But the R to the E to the P, they can’t fade me
Or my muthafuckin’ group
With the Frisco shirts and the steel toe boots
You know my posse keep it low pro
In Frisco, ‘cause that’s the way the shit go
(Everybody feel that the sky is falling
Everybody feel that the sky is falling
Everybody feel that the sky is falling)
As they see us coming up, ‘cause niggas is balling
(“Well alright”)
And we ain’t no joke
Put the pushing to the side before yo’ ass get smoked
(“I ain’t no joke”)
[Verse 4: Mr. Cee]
Now a lot of people think that niggas from the city by the Bay
Is strictly gay
But come with me to the mo-mo, all you’re gonna see
Is guts getting pound, G
‘Cause all the fags… (“are on the other side of town”)
But back to the subject at hand
You’re fuckin’ with a true blue, so let the shit hit the fan
I don’t like fairytales ‘cause I live reality
Real niggas do die, call it technicality
Or a mere loss
You was fuckin’ with a nigga in a Niners hat so you got tossed
Now do you realize what I am saying?
‘Cause Frisco niggas sho’ ain’t playing
And since I’m down with the muthafuckin’ 
HRD
Best believe this nigga ain’t no joke, G

My body shakes with just one thought of you
The door is open wide
So won't you come inside
And do those special things that lovers do
[Chorus:]
Take it while it's hot
I think the time is right
Take it while it's hot
I want your love tonight
Give it all you got
Don't let this feeling end
Take it while it's hot
Cause it may not come again
[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I'm shy
But now I think that you should know
The deeper that we go
The more my feelings show
Time passes by just like birthdays come and go
So light the candles, babe
And I'll make a wish and blow
I love the way you groove
I'm gonna make this move
It's time to live
I wanna give you what your waiting for
The lights are pink and low
I think we're good to go
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more

Come again
Come, come, come, come inside

Kept it a hunnid never a lie or never a cap for me

Crazy Janey and her mission man
 were 
back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy 
slammed on his coaster brakes
 and said anybody wanna go on up to 
Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a 
bottle of rose
 so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light
[Chorus]
And they dance like 
spirits
 in the night (All night) in the night (All night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you

Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, 
""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake 
I had my head out the window
 and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too 
loose
 to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
[Chorus]
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (All night)
In the night (All night), Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right
[Chorus]
Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night
Baby don't know what they can do to you

Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid
Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me in the coolness of the evening
Till the morning sun was shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I would smile when I'd remember
How they used to call us Jody and the kid
Now the world's a little older and the years have changed the river
Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sundays I go walking down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me
And it makes the old folks smile to see her tag along beside me
Doin' little things the way her mama did

But if it makes the moon up on high
More than just a light in the sky
If it kisses you and you find you like it too
Grab it!
It's a man!
[Instrumental]
If it whistles each time you pass
Owns a car that runs out of gas
Then it's time that you get hip, better watch your step
It's a man!
If it acts just like it's the boss
When it knows that you are of course
If it gets a little rough
Thinks it's very tough
[Scream]
It's a man!
If it walks
If it talks
If its habits are a little bit peculiar
If it brags and tries to make you think it's wonderful
Be on the look out, don't let it fool ya
But if it's kneeling down on one knee
Saying ""Darling, please marry me""
Then don't hesitate
Better name the date
And then grab it!
Hold it!
Hang onto it!
For it's a man!",3.0,3.7356738000016776

With her pretty curls and her wooden spoon
I heard you whispering to yourself last night
She’ll be coming home some day soon
Well the wine you drink is stained deep in your shirt
And just like the sin in my soul
It is never ever ever ever coming out

And the bride washing up on the shore
I could never really dance that well
I can’t raise the flags or ring them bells
But I can shoot my gun down the line towards my home
To the land of the bloody unknown

There’s a black dog watching over me﻿ in my sleep
And I stir just to toss him the bone

In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I'd been missing
But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm
[Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out
[Verse 2]
Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live. I walked away now
But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm
[Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out
[Bridge]
All because of you...
All because of you...
[Extended Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours
All because of you
I believe in angels
Not the kind with wings
No, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

There'll never be and there has never been
A ship or fleet secure against the storms
When kings upon the main have clung to pride
And held themselves as masters of the sea
I've held them down beneath the crushing tide
Till they have learned that no one masters me

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do

Slave to the power, a slave to the gold
Ruthlessly ruling the east
Your reign of terror come to an end
Fighting your unholy war

Fighters are launched from the carriers at sea
Infantry coming your way
Armored brigades engaging their lines
Regain control of black gold
Your reign of terror will come to an end
Forcing you out of control

Countdown to death we're coming for you
Making our way through the desert
Soon you will pay for the pain that you caused
Captured or dead you will cause no more harm

Your cities in ruins a people in need
Still you go on as before
Feet after feet mile after mile
Allies returning the land
Hide underground as the coward you are

Think it over my brother

Don't take for granted the smile on her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace

Through the air to your d-izz-ome, connectin' the dots
Meet your end from the chr-izz-ome, the Glock hit the spot
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: La Chat]
Look at me ho, I'm smilin, but you know ain't no love

Neighbors, no one loves you like he loves you
And no one cares like he cares
Neighbors, let us join today in the holy love of God and money
Because neighbors, no one loves you like He loves you
And what better way to show your love than to dig deep into your pockets
Dig real deep, until it hurts. Alleviate your guilt
Free yourself once again, because he gave to you, brothers and sisters
Please give a 10, 25, or 50 dollar tax-deductible donation
And I assure you your modest pledge will be used to censor TV and radio
Ban questionable books
, and contribute to many other Godly services
No longer will young Christian Americans hedonistically indulge
In masochistic submission to rhythmic music
, for with your monetary support
There is no end to what we can achieve in this country
[Chorus]
The voice of God is government
The voice of God is government
The voice of God is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
*One, two, three, four*

Can't you see what we believe in, all our thoughts, all our reasons
Pursuit of life and liberty and happiness we cannot see?
Speak of truth with a mighty voice, but politics are your real choice
Hire men to change the law, protect and serve with one small flaw
[Chorus]
Voice of God is government
The voice of God is government
Voice of God is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
[Verse 2]
If we shun God and Jesus Christ, religious love is sacrifice
Love for God is shown in cash, the love they send is mailbox trash
With every pamphlet we receive, more money asked for Godly needs
Build a million dollar church, with money spent on God's research

The voice of God is government
Voice of God is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!

On late night TV, God can heal

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, 
lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the 
Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them 
Barbary Coast girls
, 
riding shotgun
, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151
 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put 
Bronson
 on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some 
ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)
[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite
[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)
[Hittman]
Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush
 the huss,
 with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

[Verse 1]
Now, warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner, and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom
They're trying to trace the smell
There's a leaking in the washroom, there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors, someone was heard to sneeze
Goodness me, could this be industrial disease?
[Verse 2]
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified, it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies, the foreman's got the fleas
Everyone's concerned about industrial disease
There's panic on the switchboard, tongues in knots
Some come out in sympathy, some come out in spots
Some blame the management, some the employees
And everybody knows it's the industrial disease
[Verse 3]
Yeah, now the work force is disgusted, 
downs tools
, walks
Innocence is injured, experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are ""classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze""
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse
History boils over, there's an economics freeze
Sociologists invent words that mean ""industrial disease""
[Verse 4]
Doctor Parkinson declared ""I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smoker's cough from smoking
Brewer's droop
 from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the 
Betty Davis' knees
But, worst of all young man you've got industrial disease""
He wrote me a prescription he said ""You are depressed
I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later, next patient please
Send in another victim of industrial disease, ha-ha
Ha, splendid!""
[Verse 5]
And I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm-a thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer, he's singing a protest song, he says
""They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease
[Verse 6]
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind
Give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, 
page three
Two weeks in España and Sunday striptease""
Meanwhile the first Jesus says ""I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons""
The other one's out on hunger strike, he's dying by degrees
How come Jesus gets industrial disease?

Ever since the day that I was made I've been deciding the end
And I was made of wood and stone and won't diminish or bend
So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away
I'll be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay
Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me
I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me
Cause when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread
I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said

Tearing through these days I find
The tolerance to strive and push on
I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won

Without the blood of perfect life
I know I'm nothing at all
So now I reign forever hallowed in eternity's hand
No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand

Uhh... (ooooooh)
Uhh, ha ha (uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is! (let's go)
[Verse 1: Nelly (Jermaine Dupri)]
We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (c'mon)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, ""Nigga, what now?""
And today we in the club like, ""Nigga, what now?""
You better look down 'cause uhh, I know you see 'em (say what?)
I know you see 'em (say what?) I know you see 'em
I paid a thousand for the jeans, I paid 200 for the shoes
And uhh, fuck a shirt, I'mma rock these tattoos (and uh)
You see my fitted man,
 
I represent the crib
'Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
I, might pop my grill in - and I, might let my chain hang
And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on, derrty, do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's every day (uhh)
A different style, different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like
[Hook: Nelly (Jermaine Dupri)]
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's
[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Uhh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin' color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black 11's with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin' in the mirror
Straight thinkin' 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back, homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin'; number, color, everything that's happenin'
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

[Verse 3: Ciara]
I-I-I, I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop, and step out, with them things on
I got me the black and pink - patent leather with the grey
Matchin' with the skinny jeans - off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me) my jeans be never slippin' (slippin')
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
Yeahhhhh, we be fresh every day
And if you lookin' for me lil' daddy you can find me in the A! A! A! A!
[Verse 4: Nelly (Jermaine Dupri)]
I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, ""Shorty, send more""
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute, man
See, I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like ""Put a hold on 'em""
Them Carolina number 9's matchin' patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump, jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin' these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin' these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar

I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked, so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets is the punk-ass police
The first one jumped out and said, ""Freeze""
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk, please
’Cause cops should mind they business when we rush
Now you're bleedin' like a bitch 'cause you don't know how to hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker, give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo, tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosy-ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup, punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked-ass niggas
[Chorus]
Crooked-ass niggas (

Cri— Cri— Criminal—
[Verse 2: Stretch]
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick-stepping to the niggas with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock it's a motherfuckin' gank move
Stretch is uptown clockin' weight, this shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryna play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten ki's, I'ma get him, think I won't?
And my nigga 2Pac got the fuckin' Glock cocked and he's ready
When the kid didn't even bring the weight back, instead he
Welcomed us into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead, a clean geta-
Way, niggas got paid
And yet another sleepin'-ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch
[Chorus]
The crooked-ass niggas (
Criminal behavior
)
Ya don't stop (
Criminal—
)
Crooked-ass niggas (
Criminal behavior
)
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas do
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get with ya at the drop of a whistle
So make your move and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke 'til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip, I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer, I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too
[Outro]

Criminal— Criminal behavior

Crooked-ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in
They'll try to get ya, they'll sweat ya to get in the picture
And then they hit ya, son of a bitch, now he's richer

Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Magnificent ways to light your life up like an arsonist
Put my heart in this
Ticklin' you funny but when we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
Hope that you stayin' alone
I'm into givin' pleasure echoin' rhythms of my manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong, I'm too grown for games
Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin' I'm strong 'cause you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same
Boldly and bodily fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with
Fuck whoever you was gon' leave with
I'm who you should see shit
I found us some love like Adam and Eve shit
Who you should be with, your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets and your arms
And see, so don't be alarmed
If I make you feel good all over
'Cause I was strapping the bomb
That's 'cause I'm gonna be on
Even though niggas in the hood is all soldiers
You still'll suffer the consequences defenseless
Thinkin' about becomin' my wife
If I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
'Cause I be huggin' you like I'm huggin' the mic
Plus I'm the one that's rubbin' you right
And able to stick my tongue off in your navel and lick 'til you drop
Even though I like to stick to twat
I'm realizin' there's a variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm into learnin' you so pick the spot
I'll get pleasure too but let me hush and make the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet
But don't actin' like its a crime 'cause it hasn't been committed yet
But baby won't you let me get it what? Get it wet

Let me tickle your body, after the party we can pleasure
Will you come on, let me

Let me saturate you body with honey and lick it up, stick it up
After release and let it 'rupt, is it enough to

Try to marinate your mind
What's up? Am I deserving your love?
Just 'cause we up in the club
Don't think you bogus if you let me

But you be the only one that I be thinkin' of
Gimme a hug, you got me sprung in love

Last time I heard you was playing with emotions and po' pimpin'
All up in the clubs smokin' doves fuckin' hella women
Now negro, what's your steelo you want to get with me though
Then add up them zeros and lo-dos
You ain't no 'bout them weed needs, (huh?)
Pussy feeds (what?) lex keys (damn!) for Mrs. Kane
See a half is for my mommy, fuck Tommy
He ain't tryin to ask naughty
Smooth head got you right in the bed
You need another lover like you need a hole in the head
Instead of all this talkin' let your tongue do the walkin' on down this clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild hundreds bitch
Ain't that some shit?
Guaranteed to get you wet, simple kiss from petite lips
It won't take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come and take a little glimpse of the sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse
, on the freak shit
What you know about this slick clit
Send you in a thang when you feel this
Bitch, far from a virgin and sip a Burbon get the derb
And leave you hurtin' for certain
Steady splurgin' when I'm servin', get you wetter than a Persian
The X-rated version
I'm urgin' but I ain't thinkin' you can get it yet
But if you good in a minute you can get it what? Get it wet

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Got to be more careful don't hurt 'em girl, you sexy when you mad
Then nigga come hurt me baby wet me with a splash
Aggressive loving I've never had
As I enter the scene with bedroom eyes, 
Obsession cologne on,
 
Nautica robe on
Flamin' up, trippin' while stanky roll on
Herringbone on gettin' my pose on to the dome strong
Take a sip of liquor, I'm on bone
Huggin you like I ain't seen you in so long,  what's up girl?
I execute my unique approach who I be the most
Willin' to learn and try to be like I got some experience
If you need a coach or we can ride tonight

Lard, you can see it in the clouds up in the sky
Lard floats by in clusters in our water supply
Lard, it's all of us, man, in our pores and in our hair
Lard's what we conceal in those corny clothes we wear
Lard is all
Lard is divine
Lard is in control
Lard whips and chains our soul
We carry credit cards
We live in fear of art
Lard is the om
Lard is revolution
Lard is the tapeworm in the bottle of cheap tequila
That comes alive at night and sneaks up and bites your nipple
Lard
[Verse 1]
Nowadays, most of us need someone to run our personal life
Someone to see that the plants are watered
Someone to make sure the place is clean
Someone to make sure dinner is waiting
Someone to call for theater tickets
Someone to make up those cheap excuses
What we need is lard

The answer
The dancer
The ointment
The dream
Absorb it
Inflame it
Respect it
Molest it

Pity the poor trainer in the stable when the racehorse farts
Poison oak really is the aphrodisiac of the gods
When people are asleep, we must all become alarm clocks

It's dental floss of the mind
Who will babysit the babysitters?
[Verse 5]
Ever hear about the guy in New York whose dick
Fell off in the bath after he shot it full of coke?
It's okay to run out of butter in Zambia
Just smear squashed caterpillars on your toast
Waiter, there's a terrorist in my soup
Which came first, Max Headroom or Gerald Ford?
Are you a man or are you a mouse?
If you love your fun, die for it!

I guess I was just out of my teenage years when I was writing things for Teens of Denial.
 I didn't really feel like anything had changed. So, um, yeah I guess, you know, the two of those albums together are sort of, they're both an exploration of past feelings and how they connect to the present and what I'm doing in the present tense

You see in the past

I thought that we would last
Become a little family

The years were flying by, they soared

It's not happening for me, so

The addict that's inside of me
I want to fill my glass up
With you constantly
I've been here before
But I've never ever felt this sure
And now I know I've been dreaming
And your actions
Have inspired me, so

Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this

I open up, you ignore me
You're not the same at all
And if I could turn back
The pages of time I'd rewrite your point of view
Washed up on to the shore
Given one last chance
To try some more
But I'm tired, I'm freezing
Let's stop and call it history

The work, it do magic like Criss Angel (Voilà)
I'm selling more chickens than Bojangles
We shoot the chopper from your head to your ankle
So many chains on my neck, they get tangled
I'm in Atlanta, sipping Texas Ranger
Too Atlanta 'cause my goons, you can't tame them
My niggas banging GD, twist your fingers
Mystikal .45, that bitch come with danger
So many bitches, they calling me gigolo
Got a fox on my back, not talking Vivica
All of these niggas, they mimicking
Most of the money got energy, whipping up chemicals
Swag is not usual
Devil on my back, fuck Lucifer
I'm trapping, capping all these cubicles
Never made honor roll
I'm at the top and you fell off like dominoes
[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I lost my feelings for women
When I learned how it feel to thumb through the Benjamins
Due to the fact that my Rolex a fifty
Arm & Hammer like I'm John Henry
Professor Klump pockets, I'm a chemist
Racks on me like I'm playing tennis
A hundred thousand on my new Bentley
Another hundred thousand on my Breitling bezel
Gold like I’m Shabba on African, diamonds
Canary yellow like the sunset, shining
I'm selling 16's, ain't talking 'bout rhyming
I'm looking for droughts to change the climates
No comprendo, they come away and bought pesos
Got the clay and serve the folks, call it Clay-Doh
I think I heard my front door
Go get the scope, hundred bricks for Diego
[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
Speaking of the yayo, Young Guapo, Young Guapo, he all about pesos
Switcharoo on your main bitch, me and my nigga, hell nah, we won't date hoes
You speaking about Christian Louboutin? Well, we get them in by the caseload
I'm a boss like Rozay
, Young Guapo got niggas on the payroll
We used to it, not new to it, just stacking up the paper
Went from standing on the block to smoking OG in skyscrapers (top floor condo)
My niggas got beams, no lasers
Cavalli my jeans, ten chains on with a Versace blazer
Longway, bitch
[Verse 4: Peewee Longway]
Longway reloaded, blood on my blue Benjamin like a Crip runner, trap will blow his out
Balenci' Givenchy, I trap and dab
Five naked bitches give me bubble bath
Longway Nino Brown
Put my foot in the cage just to break a pound
I'm fiending for it, they want brown sugar
She sneaking and geeking on Sugar Hill
Bitches suck my dick, trying to get it shooting
Longway put the bitch out with the roof
Pablo my plug and the mistress blew me
Call the little bitch Susie Choosy
At the Chevron, rolling up a doobie
Taking pictures, this ain't no camera, you're a movie
Longway Bond, you too groovy
Longway Bond, boy, you groovy?
And my backwood stuffed crushed fruity
And I don't wanna fuck the bitch if she ain't cute
The bitch gon' juug me a Cuban
And my Rolex blue
Strawberry, vanilla, chocolate three scoops
My diamonds confused her
She think she on roofies
Diamonds from Africa, shout out from Frank Lucas
Fresh out the banana boat with my hooligans
We come for the dope and we come from Sinise
I make the white boy jump, my wrist a chemist
Now they bow down to me like I’m the minister
Chopping bricks at the penitentiary
Damn, a young nigga tripping
Over a hundred of them fucking with some bitches
Hold it down, these niggas snitching
I'm the reason why y'all niggas cripping
Young nigga do it for the hood
Chopper with a wood grain handle
Young nigga Bangkok, call me Hancock
The chopper still got you shaking dreadlocks
With your bitch in the film for the bedrock
Pussy ass nigga caught a case, said it's deadlocked
Turned around, shot him with the same Glock
[Verse 5: Quavo]
So you say you shot him with the same Glock
Young nigga feeling like 2Pac
Still will hit a nigga with the rerock
Worth about a Bentley and I'm riding in a tee-top
They go in a frantic, but don't panic
They calling me Quavo, the stick-them-up bandit
He wanted the chopper, I let them have it
We hop on the PJ, touchdown on Atlantic
Tried to hit the Sprinter, now it's bulletproof
Try to fuck a Migo, bet a nigga shoot
Deuce deuce, pocket rocket in the VIP booth
Now you wanna ask me what you do
Water diamonds like a swimming pool
Had to spend two thousand for Margiela shoes
Young Quavo whipping up the chemicals
Hell nah, nigga never finished school
SRT Audi, I'm dabbing and I got your bitch that wanna leave her junkies in it
Mama, she told me, ""Go get the bitch"", I put my wrist in the water, it started swimming
On the north side, we were really getting it, then I'm stepping and spinning it, Longway in it

“There is no peace on earth, ” I said
“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

And you could move mountains, the swords of fire
They keep you around to watch their house of gold
Keep the hungry away from the sacred grove
You were holy and you made me wonder how
But you looked like a devil who would sieze and shake you down
On the hopes of a tyrant

I can see her standing here
When I smell those orange blossoms then I'm there
We swam in the lake we watched fire flies by night
She was my princess and I was her knight
But her daddy didn't like me He ain't like how I look
He said leave that boy be and that's all that it took

Laid back, all I know
Destination, unknown
Riding high, seats low

Deers drinkin', mountain streams
Full plate, day dreams

Wood burnin', love the smell

[Verse 1: Rittz]
In my old school bumpin' that ""Kiss of Life"" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured
But now the storms finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You can say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
Cause what awaits for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone

This ain't no ordinary love
I was sick of being poor and said ""enough""
Right up 85 North and there I was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing out the torch I carry
I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown, I'm in my... zone
[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Batmobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm-
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

In time to break down
She left a note up on the dresser

I wanna panic
Yeah, I've had it, I go-oh-oh-oh

Looking through the paper today
Looking for a specific page
Don't wanna find her full name followed by dates
Because when I left her alone
She made a sound, like a moan
""You're known by everyone for everything you've done""
Fuck buying flowers for graves
I'd rather buy you a one-way non-stop
To anywhere, find anyone, do anything
Forget and start again, love
She said she won't go
It hurts too much to stand by
You've got to stop and draw a line
Everyone here has to choose a side tonight
The moment of truth is haunting you
Don't forget your family
Regardless what you choose to do
You can't decide
And they're all screaming ""why won't you?""
I'll start the engine but I can't take this ride for you
I'll draw your bath, I'll load your gun
I hope so bad that you'll bathe and hunt

Annie's tired of forgetting about today
And always planning for tomorrow, yeah, tomorrow

If they never find a cure to all her problems, her problems
And she said, as long as she had someone near to make it clear
She doesn't need to solve them, yeah, to solve them

It's filling me with anger and resentment"" yeah, resentment

And even if it was so
Oh I wouldn't let you go
You could run run run run but I would follow close
Someday you will say ""that's it, that's all""
But I'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall

Leave a steak out the door,

We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof

I know Momma, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one
 and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red

You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, 
I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action
, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, 
y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, 
like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, 
truly yours, Frank White

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs 
bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be
[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the '
Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, 
we just macin' them
, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

Now I'm not saying that she's cheating, but seeing is believing
Can't believe it what I'm seeing when I stepped inside
[Chorus]
She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday
[Verse 2]
She turns and says don't be surprised, it's going to be a good night
A good, good night
She's showing me a different side, one I've never seen before
That I ignore
Cause when I'm up she's all about me
When I'm down she stays around me
Now I know I'm one and only
So I might as well enjoy the ride

Arriving at L. Ron Hoover's modernistic office / cathedral / ware-house / condominium complex, Joe is greeted by a pre-recorded message and a dramatically illuminated image on a wall-sized TV screen
[Intro: L. Ron Hoover]
Welcome to the First Church of Appliantology!
The White Zone is for loading and unloading only!
[Chorus: L. Ron Hoover]
Don't you be tarot-fied
It's just a token of my extreme
Don't you be tarot-fied
It's just a token of my extreme
Don't you never try to look behind my eyes
You don't wanna know what they have seen
Don't you never try to look behind my eyes
You don't wanna know what they have seen
[Verse 1: Joe]
Some people think
That if they go too far
They'll never get back
To where the rest of them are
I might be crazy
But there's one thing I know
You might be surprised
At what you find out when ya go!
[Lyric Note 2]
And thus, having rationalized his expedition to L. Ron's modernistic office / cathedral / warehouse / condominium complex, JOE seeks the answer to his problem
[Verse 2: Joe & 
L. Ron Hoover
]
Oh, oh, oh, Mystical Advisor
What is my problem, tell me, can you see?
Well, you have nothing to fear, my son!
You are a Latent Appliance Fetishist, it appears to me!
That all seems very, very strange
I never craved a toaster or a color T.V
A Latent Appliance Fetishist
Is a person who refuses to admit to his or herself
That sexual gratification can only be achieved
Through the use of machines!
Get the picture?
[Verse 3: Joe & 
L. Ron Hoover
]
Are you telling me
I should come out of the closet now, Mr. Ron?
No, my son!
You must go into The Closet!
What?
And you will have
Eh?
Hey! A lot of fun!
That's where they all live
So if you want an appliance to love you
You'll have to go in there and get you one
Well, that seems simple enough!
Yes, but if you want a really good one
You'll have to learn a foreign language!
German, for instance?
That's right
A lot of really cute ones come from over there!
Fifty bucks, please!
[Lyric Note 3]
And a cheerful group of Appliantologists dance into the room wearing aluminum foil lab smocks, lock arms in a circle around JOE, making sure he pays in full, all the while singing with L. RON as he delivers his final instructions
[Chorus: Appliantologists]
If you've been modified
It's an illusion, and you're in between
Don't you be tarot-fied
It's just a lot of nothin' so what can it mean?
If you've been modified
It's an illusion, and you're in between
Don't you be tarot-fied
It's just a lot of nothin' so what can it mean?
If you've been modified
It's an illusion, and you're in between
[Outro: Central Scrutinizer]
This is the Central Scrutinizer...
Joe has just learned to speak German
Now, get this, here's why he did it!
He's gonna go to this club on the other side of town
It's called The Closet...
And they got these Appliances in there that really go for a guy
Dressed up like a housewife who can speak German
(you know what I mean) ...so Joe's learned how to speak German
He goes in this place and he sees these little Kitchen Machineries
Dancing around with each other, and he sees this one...
That looks like it's a cross between an industrial vacuum cleaner
And a chrome piggy bank with marital aids stuck all over its body...
It's really exciting... and when he sees it, he bursts into song...",2.0,3.096703700000944

I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, 
Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team, I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs
Many times I've, thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found

Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned?
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

[Verse 1: Crucifix]
Sometimes I just get caught up, quick to forgetting the way that I was brought up. Running around town pissed, fists balled up, remembering everything but what my mama taught us; “In a world so cold, pave your own path or walk a beat road. Try to get money but don’t let it be your goal, or gain the whole world and still lose your own soul.” I’d rather be poor and learn to love the way that feels than rob and steal to make my meals or pay my bills. God, I’m really trying to understand that the pain is just the frame to show the man that I am. And I’m gonna wake up in the morning knowing life gon’ be hard, but that’s another reason just to keep on talking to God. And it’s a bet, I’ll come out a little bit scarred, but I can wake up in the morning and know which side that I’m on

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
In any event I’m plenty content. Of my sins I repent, then give me the rent, and try to give it my best then give Him the rest. I was losing with more... been winning with less. I need to reevaluate what more is, is it more bullshit? Or is it more really more about more closeness with the Big Man? Hey I'm a big fan, and I can withstand, I can endure... I can persevere because I'm ensured  by faith and that leaves no room for fear no more... Turn the music up!

It could be better if I tried harder. My caddy's in the shop I guess I gotta ride the Marta. But I thank God I'm alive, that's what I do for starters. God will provide so I grind for my sons and daughter. My house is under water swimming in a sea of debt, but my faith is strong and Lord knows I need some help. But every cloud has a silver lining so don't forget, what goes down must come up now to catch a breath
Mama keeps praying, the world don't stop spinnin'... What makes a loser lose?  What makes a winner win? Win or lose, learn young or forever be a damn fool. Fail and quit, that's what the weak do. I'm a fighter y'all, morning, noon and night. Tito Ortiz, Mike Tyson, Kimbo Slice... Life gives me lemons, I'm gon' make pie, then I can use the peeling to make the stars rise!
Milledgeville bound... I love a small town you ain't gotta have money, they're just glad you're around. I could've been a lot of places but I'm out here free. The best things in life come without no fee. The few people that ain't here truly will be missed, pour a shot to the ground before I take my sip. It's been a long road, a lot of hardship. But I'm glad for the ride so regardless... Life Is Good!

And a seven-headed Hydra livin' in my swimmin' pool
In the land of the dead

It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now
[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
[Verse 2]
I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing
[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
[Bridge]
It`s not too near for me
Like a flower
I need the rain
Thought it`s not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again
[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name

I remember the smell of the creosote plant
When we'd have to eat on Easter with my crazy old uncle and aunt
They lived in a big house, antebellum style (antebellum)
And the winds would blow across the old bayou
And I was a tranquil little child

Life was just a tire swing
'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing
Blackberry pickin', eatin' fried chicken
And I never knew a thing about pain
Life was just a tire swing

In a few summers my folks packed me off to camp
Yeah me and my cousin' Baxter in our pup tent with a lamp
And in a few days Baxter went home and he left me by myself
But I knew that I'd stay, it was better that way
And I could get along without any help

'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing
Chasin' after sparrows with rubber-tipped arrows
Knowin' I could never hurt a thing
Life was just a tire swing (tire swing)

And I never been west of New Orleans or east of Pensacola
My only contact with the outside world was an RCA Victrola
And Elvis would sing and then I'd dream about expensive cars
And who would've figured twenty years later
I'd be rubbin' shoulders with the stars
Life was just a tire swing
[Verse 4]
Then the other mornin' on some Illinois road
I fell asleep at the wheel
But was quickly wakened up by a 'Ma Bell' telephone pole
And a bunch of Grant Wood faces screamin' ""Is he still alive?""
Through the window I could see it hangin' from a tree
And I knew that I had survived

Sun up to sun down, take it straight with no chaser
Them dirt road racers, bonfire kings
Boss of the sticks, with an outlaw regime
Jug of white whiskey and some fresh cut crop
That's how you push it to the limit when the party don't stop
Them southern gals love it, said ""We're down for a fight""
'Cause you know anything can happen on a bonfire night

It was gorgeous on the outside, inside it was just a machine
It was the fastest thing I’ve ever seen
I first met Victoria at Victoria station
We’d always talked about going for a beer
She said, “It’s strange now that you’re here.”
We went back to her place, 57th we’d cross it
She’s as poor as me but she looks twice as good
I told her that because it’s something I would
She shrugged a little and she turned off the fauset
And later on as we were crawling into bed
I was thinking on something my father had said
He said, “You’re better off, off of the main drag.”

So I guess this is goodbye""
What? What did you do it for?
Every time I think of you and him together
I break down and cry
Oh, I, I can remember
The tears I've cried
Since you say goodbye
I can remember
I can remember

Yo, me and Cool V
Dis dis dis gon' be dis gon' be our new single
And when you hear this story you'll say it's aight though
Yo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue
One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in
[Verse One]
Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin, flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, cause..
[Chorus: Biz sings - voice slowed down]
It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love
[Verse Two]
Now girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Now fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin that a girl posess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

But that don’t mean that I gotta stay home, yeah

You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?
[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go
[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill

I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sipping a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd seperated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget, here we go

So my hours are 9 to 5 and my job is the streets
I'm in a low position trying to hold these missions
Crenshaw to Exposition filling holiday wishes
And the block (West Adams) and the spot (we sure had em)
Rally's on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right and that's gangster
[Hook]
When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out my bed
I will always be a hustler
I will always chase my bread
Since this one's for my people
I'ma make sure you hear what I said
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head
[Verse 4: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing of where you been
Can't go to sleep a child and expect to wake a man
Yo life is a lesson, niggas who don't study
End up failing tests and blame it on me
But see Sheist only is what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in these streets
Heart in these beats, flows sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't chart my highest of peaks
I'm with the Ree so you knowin' what they saying of me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hit em' with a new vaccine
I leave em' comatose falling asleep

When I get up out my bed

If you've got love
You can move a mountain a little bit further down the line
You can do it all at once or one rock at a time
You can turn a ordinary picture into a priceless work of art
That's what you can do if you've got love in your heart
Now there's nothing like a real good friend to tell your troubles to
But there's just so much a real good friend can't do
'Cause it takes a lover's touch to chase the darkest blues away

We could't start over
It isn't a game
We can change all the rules
And lose just the same
We could't start over
We don't even know
If we've come to the end
Now where could we go
There's no need to start over
There's nothing to fear
Let's not start over
Let;s play it from here
We couldn't start over
We've been there before
Let's be different this time
And try not keeping score
There's no need to start over
There's nothing to fear
Let's not start over
Let's play it from here
We've come a long way
Right or wrong
The season's change with the weather
We've said all we can say
Longing to belong
Going our own way

Had to come on up for air

Now you’re talking to me all the time
Do you know you’re no good at listening?
But you’re really good at saying everything on your mind
It must be tiring, trying so hard
To look like you’re not really trying at all
I guess if you’re afraid of aiming too high
Then you’re not really gonna have too far to fall

Drowning in the dregs

To look into a mirror
Or at the very worst some kind of God
You need something to believe in
I just wish it was yourself
Try to summon up the guts
To rectify your ailing health
For there's something round the corner
Waiting just out of sight
That'll stop you feeling low and limp
And naked to the night

Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade

Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat -
Behind her small eyes, sunk deep in her fat
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon
But dreamin' just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feedin' daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Bunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night -
A warehouse of strangers in 60-watt lights
Starin' through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young P.F.C
Donald!
And there were spaces between Donald...
And whatever he said
Strangers had forced him
To live in his head
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks' latrines
But dreamin' just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feedin' daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Hot love, cold love, no love at all
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall
Nothin' is wrong and nothin' is right
Donald and Lydia
Made love that night
Love!
They made love in the mountains
They made love in the streams
They made love in the valleys
They made love in their dreams
And when they were finished
There was nothin' to say -
Because mostly they made love from
Ten miles away

And the moon was covered up with clouds

He said don't you go walking cross my bridge
I am gonna make it rough on you
I will give you swamp fever

Getting it to the swamp music
Get it on - Get it on

He said would you mind if I borrowed that old guitar of yours?
And show you all a lick
Since we never heard a troll play we let him have it
And he said like this right here now ...
I said yes sir troll you can play it

But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time

Can it really last forever?
Keep searchin' through this fire within
Seeking without any answers
All the simple lines I've heard before
Doesn't make it any easier to find

From the blind misuser
And they told me that love
Is a game made of broken rules
But I know there's a love that's complete
Where there's nothing missing inside
The hope of the brokenhearted
Longing for love again
What is all that love requires?
Will it finally bring contentment?
Or a sacrifice of my desires
To love as just a humble servant?
Every kind of love I've fallen for
Leaves my crying out for something more in the end
And I learned about love on the street
From the cruel and heartless
Where love is a game of deceit
Played by selfish fools, yeah
But I know there's a love that's complete
Where there's nothing ugly to hide
The hope of the brokenhearted
Longing for love again
The hope of the brokenhearted

I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas
And I know the lonesome sound is following
I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand
And when to hold when queens are staring back at me
Once I was a carpenter and man my hands were callused
I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry
And I left the timbers rotting where they lay
[Chorus]
Forever I will move
Like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction
I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender

If I live the life I'm given I won't be scared to die

I don't come from Detroit
But her diesel motors pulled me
And I followed til I finally lost my way
And now I spend my days in search
Of a woman we call Purpose
And if I ever pass back through her town I'd stay

Forever I will move
Like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction
I'll look up to the sky
And when the black dress drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender
And remember we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given I won't be scared to die

And my life is but a coin pulled from an empty pocket
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
Hope and fear go with it
And the moon and the sun go spinning
Like the numbers and the fruit before our eyes
Sometimes I hit
Sometimes it robs me blind
Sometimes I hit
Sometimes it robs me blind

I have a friend, he understands
I have a friend, he understands
[Verse 1]
There's nothing new under the sun
Questions we have
Have been said and done
Fully God and man
He felt it all, all, all
High as king but still
He's low enough
To meet us where we are
[Chorus]
He understands
He was alone, left by his friends
And foxes have holes
He had nowhere to go
No place to lay his head
So if anyone knows
He undеrstands
I have a friend, he undеrstands
He understands
[Verse 2]
I've found a friend in the high priest
Who's not out of touch with reality
He was a man tempted like me
So I won't feel guilty
He gives me space to be
What he made me
[Chorus]
He understands
He was alone, left by his friends
Foxes have holes
He had nowhere to go
No place to lay his head
So if anyone knows
He understands

The pain you feel inside
He understands
The tears you cry at night
He understands
I know you want to hide
He understands
I know you want to run away
He understands (Woah oh-oh-oh)
He understands
I'm so glad he understands (He understands)
He's my friend and he understands
He understands
I don't have to worry
I don't have to fret
He understands (Woah oh-oh-oh)

Even if no one else understands
He understands

Foxes have holes
He had nowhere to go
No place to lay his head

He's felt everything that I've felt
He's lived through it all
He understands
I have a friend, he understands, he understands
I have a friend, he understands
I have a friend, he understands
I have a friend, he understands
I have a friend, he understands
He's felt it all
Tempted by it all
Still he was sinless
He's lived through it all
Every question
Every fear
Every feeling
He's right here
He understands
You're not alone in your confusion
You're not alone in your doubt
You're not alone in your frustration

Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle

Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brother's Glock
And that's the day my life changed, 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch

Yo
The first time I heard Digital Underground I was in the first grade
My homie, Lace, brought it over and he dubbed it on a mixtape
I would do the Humpty Hump and perform to his verses
12 Years later, I learned that Shock G and him were the same person
I loved Hammer I can't front he taught me how to dance
Along with Bell Biv DeVoe I had Jay-O's and a pair of zebra pants
But this was the foundation
What would come to be a life long passion, journey and drive an MC
Some people ask me what it means
I dont know where to start
Its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart
When I first stepped to do a cypher in a jam at the park
I got served No for real I got served
But see I learned something observed others
And watched an urge hungered
Verse studier earned a turn on that block
I dont care who you are or where you're from or what you believe in
But if you love Hip Hop I bet
Its more or less for the same reason
This is it when you spit you exist in that moment
And if you're sick with that gift you then rip it when you perform it
Then all the shit that you live begins to lift off your shoulders
And the audience well they get to experience where your soul is
The most amazing feeling rocking a crowd to your anthem
To the front to the back with their motherfucking hands up
Cause I'm an MC won't be the first won't be the last
Just another B-Boy and I'ma die in my stance
[Hook]
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can crab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb your art now
If you got a floor and you're fast kick that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can crab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb whole damn town
But If you live for hip hop dont ever put your hands down
Dont put your hands down Keep that shit up
We're gonna rock it like this
It goes front back front back front back front Come on
It goes front back front back I said front back
To my people you know it
It goes front back front back it goes front back
Okay, bring it down
[Verse 2]
Now I don't know if it's the clothes, the hoes or the cars
That make people rap like they're trapped inside these bars
This shit ain't complicated, man, just be who you are
Too busy searching for the light, missing the fact that you're a star
Now who's got passion? Stand the hell up
'Cause I wanna hear somebody rapping who's got it inside their cuts
Now you can get intricate, displaying your fancy cadences
But if you're not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit
I said ""Who's going to teach the kids?""
You wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims
All the money in the world can help you look like a star
But money can't buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars
And I like nice shit too
Believe me, I got a closet full of Nikes and whole bunch of Velour suits
Fitted white Tees and an Icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip-hop
But look beyond it when I record to these beats
But if I don't speak me
What's the difference between my lyrics and what you hearin' on MTV
People fear that if they're steering away from the mainstream
Then their album won't sell, well, I could give a fuck
I'm just gonna freestyle and spit what's inside my gut
And if you want to you can go and label me conscious
But just remember there's a kid at a bus stop beatboxing
Whose life's will be affected by what's inside of his Walkman
[Hook]
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb your art now
If you got a floor and you're fast kick that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad put your heart down
If you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down
If you got a marker and a can bomb the whole damn town
But if you live for Hip Hop dont ever put your hands down",1.0,2.2497647999989567

Copy and they clone what I'm feedin', they be thievin'
China white in my home, be strategic, I gotta feed ya
Grind up on my own 'cause I see how they mistreat me

Clear like white Patron, I can see it, you conceited
Talkin' on the phone, you can hear my tone, mischievous
Plastic or the chrome, whatever we need to keep us heated
Canary yellow stone, girl, shine on my demons
I feel it in my bones when you takin' out my semen
I purchased a couple Cashmere sweaters this evening
Take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
Half a ticket, pullin' up on you and mamacita
Give you the keys in her face to show her how I treat you
I'm takin' you out on dinner dates, 
got Franklins like Aretha
Trained in the war zone, codeine in my one liter
Pain in my attitude, it's vicious and it's lethal
Came off the avenue and ran into a diva
Broken-hearted, baby had me down, had to get you
You out the garden, baby, I'm from the jungle with the leeches
Clouded my lungs up and I slowly started speakin'
Rain, thunderin', showin' you grace for this meetin'
Givin' you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
Fall in love with revenge, hopin' that'll kill my demons
Sittin' out on my porch, I'm in disbelief
Give me glory, give me Lori, that's victory
Moment I drop your name, is it chemistry?
Fuck this money and fame if it's meant to be
Like a rock star showin' up at a symphony
Rock hard, pissin' on my enemy
Fuck 'em all, we don't show 'em sympathy
Her favorite color blue, I bought her Tiffany
Out the trap spot, I got my dope degree
They persuaded me, they gon' try to persuade you to leave
Had laid in it, played in it, and stayed in it for weeks
Mistakes like earthquakes, they can't break us a piece
I'm not Catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
Acrobatic flips, gettin' European cash 'cross the sea
It's so radical, automatic-al, I'm knowin' we elite
Fascinated by the lifestyle, you know it bring greed
Fascinated by your vices, it's okay
Fascinated over your crisis, it's warfare
When we roll one, we converse, we like orphans
Coast to coast, float the ocean like a starfish
Check my post, I'ma toast to the heartless
That's why I'm prayin' for better days on this continent

Damn – gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl, just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, ohhhhhhhhhh

Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you — can we make this work, boo?
I know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
Waitin' to exhale while I'm sittin' in the county jail
Keep your head up, ‘cause things are gettin' better
My cellmate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the sufferin' that I feel
Who can I trust? And if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
Huh, I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
Thanks for bein' there much more than a friend

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence
[Verse 3]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence
[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""

Why paint this house again?
When the floorboards creak and pull you from your slumber
Well I'd hold you 'til the end

To keep that highway's call to me away
And another, further still

Feel at home, no matter how long I may stay

They told me to put my back into it
Well, give me the pen cause I'm back into it
Rap's ruined, guess I'm here to finish the carnage
And whatever's not ash just discard it as garbage
Spitting hard shit, petrified turds
I hate you bumpin' Soulja Boy, it gets on my nerves
So much to the point I try to ignite him in flame
When I was, inkin' his verse I didn't write out his name
You know them anorexic
Pan the camera, gat 'em an' exit
Poopin' in the future I gotta be on that next shit
Bet this
Son of a monkey's uncle is breathless
Wanna be a rapper well get him a fuckin' necklace
Throwing Last Dragon I'm 'bout to hit 'em with neck kicks
Texas Chain Saw, bitches off of the checklist
Next is
Something for nothing, dinner for breakfast
A Rosary, a Bible, two idiots and a death kiss
Go!

Mad at somebody matchin' my hand
Scratch it against the pack
Sorry I'm trashin' the party, don't give a fuck

Approached her like what's good baby?

I laugh and flash my chain

To please, ya heard me
With that gangsta love, girl come ride with a G
Rolled up some of that sticky
Since she like to smoke
Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast
Pulled into the driveway
Hopped out and opened the door
Ya'll might think that's weak
But all the real playas know
Got inside, said she's cold
So I turned the heat on
Persian rug on the floor
To wipe ya feet on
And in 15 minutes, head boss gonna get beat on
She ain't got no man
Ain't got no woman
Who there to cheat on?
Can I get it?

Hell yea, there go the soap, lotion and baby powder

Glad I ain't buying
This something you'd want to see
Instantly, I snuck in
Then she told me, get in
I grabbed to glasses and a bottle of that Seagrams Gin
So we got in the Ja'causezi
Cause its more relaxing
Call me Mr. Miyabi
Cause that ass I'm gonna be waxing
She got a little tipsy
Then started feeling on me
Then start feeling on herself
Yep, its going down homey
Next thing I know
She went down...I got blessed
Then she got on top and let it drop
You know the rest

I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
""I can't believe it! I got shot!""
Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in
I be like, ""You don't know me... fool""
And color him purple (why?), 'cause he ain't in my circle
Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end

Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

No, you didn't have to stoop so low

About the coming of a Savior

In the town of Bethlehem
With a bright star o'er the stable
Was born the Son Of Man
Oh the angels were rejoicing
As the tiny baby cried
For the hope of man's salvation
In a manger had arrived
Meek as a lowly shepherd
But the mightiest of kings
He gives peace and life eternal
To whosever calls His name
Oh Emmanuel
The Father's precious Son
Who forgives our sins and washes clean
The hearts of everyone
What a wonderful beginning
To the greatest story ever told
His birth still rings with promise
As true as in days of old
So let us sing His praises
And let us open up our hearts
And receive His timeless message
That gives us all a brand new start

This whole world is fucked up
And I'm a product of this fucked up world
I Need Help
[Verse 1: Prozak]
First let me start this rhyme out with some truth
I was shaking and Sweating like Colin Farrell in the phone booth
Visions in hell like off my brains like flames and constricts like chains
And it all comes together like drugs to veins
So tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
Even groupie bitches never get involved with me
Cuz I hear voices
Or make murderous choices
Stare at their crotches while I mumble strange noises
Fuck it I guess it really doesn't matter
I'm not here to impress just infecting and make there brain splatter
I shovel two garbage bags in a shallow grave
I speak in tongues and cut my face every time I shave
A ritual habitual so peep the principals
Deadly syllables in three second intervals
My mind is fucked up so suspect so criminal
Put you In the ground with the phosphates and minerals

These boys really need some help (This is true)
Cuz They want to hurt themselves (Or you Too)
Scatter Brain they may seem (Somebody)
Wake them From this dream (They Need Some Help)

I'm the pinnacle of strangeness
I peel away the pain and flesh
Until I'm faceless
Unnecessary anguish
Nothing but a voice no bleeding on the track
With the belief that if it's dead it can come back
I ate my soul I swallowed it whole
And stitched up my torso with a handful of staples
The walking dead deaf dumb and blind
Stab both of my eyes but I can see you in my mind

I've tried pills jumping off of window sils
But nothing could fulfill my thrill
To just kill myself
I won't lie I really need alot of help
I won't die but I'd really like to try like hell
But now I found a group of people just like me

It's no secret that I do weird shit
I take a hooker and make her my bitch
And mouth kiss her in the mosh pit

Make your own destiny, find your own place
Where the streets speak the lessons of trouble, hope and pain
[Chorus]
Never stop believing change will come
There's a city of hope beyond our fears
Where miracles happen
Where truth can be heard
Do  you want to go to the city of hope
Founded on faith
Connecting us all
A network of love to answer the call
Yeah, that's where I am from
The city of hope
I hear them whisper, sending a prayer
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder
[Chorus]
Never stop believing change will come
There's a city of hope beyond our fears
Where miracles happen
Where truth can be heard
Do  you want to go to the city of hope
Yeah, that's where I found the city of hope",2.0,2.9730998999948497

But when I walk in the room they pose like statues
I size 'em all up, I used to take my pick
But now I'm on some high powered new improved shit
Deep down inside, it never goes away
I just might knock a few hoes today
It's okay, I really get paid makin' phone calls
Told you once before, I'm in it for the long haul
The last in the business, make the transition
Do I have what it takes or do you have the right intentions to git with a playa
Even if it means you gotta play the background so you can see some green
No video's or groupies, whoever got the talent
Rush her to the house and let her pose for the camera
Don't let the freak in you keep you up all night
Get your money on girl, don't waste your life

She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night

Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!

And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band

Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and it Feels So Right
And it’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!

Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
Even Barry White ain't  going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start

And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right

Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier
[Verse 1]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs, official mob figures
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be lost in my own mind
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' ""Fuck the police!"" as I ride through the night streets
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life, I will be

A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes…
[Verse 2]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin', ""Bloody murder, murder!""
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homie had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals – tell me, what you want, Lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord
The situation's critical, nothin' is colder
Than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!
Who wanna see me in a challenge?
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan
One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' 60 years
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promise us is death, nigga
Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga
It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothin' colder

Remember when I took you up

If God crossed us, we'd take all his drugs
Burn his money and his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

To turn this all to ashes
Together as one and against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure it crashes

Let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite

We were something fatal that fell into the wrong hands

Ayo, mugshot, gun shot, dope shot, jump shot
Take your pick—but you only get one shot
Advice from a schoolteacher to a young tot
Applyin' a sticker to his Spider-man lunchbox
When even role models tell us we're born to be felons
We're never gettin' into Harvard
 
or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'
It's not fair that's all they can tell us
That's why I hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday
That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calisthenics
If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it
My point of destination's different from where I was headed
'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it
One shot
[Hook: Black Thought]
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot

When opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it
Answer the door, welcome it, let it in, or regret it
They said if you can't beat 'em, you join 'em
I say, ""Forget it""
'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed
Be American, express how you feel and take the credit
Don't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and
Take off, shake all the hate off, it's over
It's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders
Must admit, I'm feelin', um, kinda, um
Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher
Than a stealth fighter pilot with my 
eye on every prize
I surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter (Yeah)

Rise up
If you livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

Every city, every hood, we need to rise up
All my soldiers, what's good? We need to wise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to wise up
Rise up!
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'
And been learnin' to be the type of person
To display how determined I get when I'm certain
Inside I feel that fire that's burnin'
Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'
Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops
And never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I come again holdin' down Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been
Feelin' the hunger
 and feedin' the lust to win (Lust to win)
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my 
one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it

Really rich but grind like I ain't got shit at all
I give them just a little, but now I want it all
It's already won when they ask what I ball for
For all the times you no pick up whеn I called ya
I know when I came in to this world, I was solo
So to mе your opinion na your nyash-hole
Don't vex because I said I did it to my own, oh
If I enter fire now shey una go follow

No lie, no cap, God knows

I have dug deep into your heart, and I discovered lies
They gon' tell my story, I'm that nigga, what they summarize
I came out a winner, I don't care what happened otherwise
Long nights I remember we don't ask to let them cutters ride
Made it out the gutter, can't go back to what I used to do
We just get money, fuck hoes, you know, the usual
And this shit forever, can't accept the thought of losin' you

I was in the mansion celebrating with the family

Obviously I never cared about your understanding
Got the biggest honour from Port Harcourt City
Whole time I was there, I was just looking at my daddy
Felt like nothin' else seeing him as proud he can be
I get emotional when I talk about my daddy
Who'd have thought I'd take it this far?
Did it all with my art and it came from the heart
Now they take me to court
But it's cool because my Richard Mille is now worth half a mil
And the price goin' up so I don't need no love

Ayo, Storm, time's up
Time's up
[Verse 1]
You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who did I offend, rappers, sit back, I’m 'bout to begin
Bout foul talk you squawk, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw, did, or heard about
All told firsthand, never word of mouth
What’s in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder?
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about killer instincts
Will turn bitch and knowin' damn well they lack in this 
division
The connoisseur crackin' your head with a four-by-four
Realize, sucker, I’ll be the comin' like Noah
Always simmer you down, perpetratin' façade and what you consider an image
To me, this is just a scrimmage
I’m feel I’m stone, not ‘cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain’t true, I feel
(Their time’s limited, hardrocks’ too)
[Scratching]
“Their time’s limited, hardrocks’ too”
[Verse 2]
Speakin' in tongues about what you did but you never done it
Admit it, you bit it ‘cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I’m fed up with the bull on this focus of weed and clips
And Glock's gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It’s the same ol' same ol', just strainin' from the anal
The content is not complexed or vexed
So why you pushin' it? Why you lyin' for? I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucker as a kid
Your persona’s drama that you acquired in high school in acting class
Your whole aura is Plexiglass
What’s-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That’s a lie, you was in church wit' your moms
See, I know, yo, slow your roll, give a “good to go”
Guys be lackin' in this thing called “rappin' just for dough”
Of course, we got to pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I’d rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It’s the principle of it, I get a rush when I bust some dope lines I wrote
That maybe somebody’ll quote
That’s what I consider real in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work, they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody’s either crime-related or sexual
I’m here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
To traps I’m not stickin', rappers, stop flippin'
For those who pose lyrical but really ain’t true, I feel

Now why this man's soul was bleeding
The angel had to understand
So invisible, he stood by him
And then gently touched his hand
Which caused the man to stand there still
Despite the winter's cold
And while he stood there in that trance
The angel read his soul
It seemed the man was not always like
The man he had become
And that angel wondered how that change had happened
And when it had begun
The man had been born to a kind and religious family
And raised in the midwest
And all throughout his childhood
This man, clearly, had been blessed
He grew up believing, among other things
Man was made in the image of god
He went to school, observed all rules
While working very hard
He had always tried to help others
Excelled at nearly every task
And when he'd graduated high school
Of course, he was the first one in his class
And in his eighteenth summer
When it was time for him to leave
He had offers from several colleges
All of them ivy league
And at college in all his studies
He always received straight ""a""s
And when he tried his hand in theater
He got the lead in the senior play
It appeared to nearly everyone
There was no talent that he lacked
And for three years on the football team
He was, the star quarterback
And there he also met the girl
Who did become his wife
With her, his world was now complete
He had the perfect life
When they had graduated college
They were wed in a ceremony quite grand
Then they moved to new york
In a dream they seemed caught
Where all had been perfectly planned
She decorated their park avenue apartment
In a 1920's art-deco style
And six months after they had moved in
She told him, they would soon be having a child
And after their first ultrasound
He knew they were having a son
Their lives could not have been better
And they had only just begun
Together they arrived early at the hospital
On the delivery date
The father was taking no chances
And did not want to risk being late
But while waiting outside the delivery room
He could tell that something was going wrong
For too many doctors were rushing in
With none coming out for too long
When her own doctor finally came out
With several nurses at his side
He said that his wife had started hemorrhaging
And despite their best efforts, she died
Then in an effort to console him
A nurse gave him his newborn to hold
But from the way the child felt limp in his arms
He knew there was still more bad news to be told
The doctor then gave the prognosis
As gently as anyone could
But before he could finish explaining
The father only too well understood
The child had been cut off from oxygen
For minutes, which is far too long
The damage was now irreversible
His brain permanently malformed
He'd never hold a job
Learn to read or ever talk
And it would be a miracle
If the child even learned how to walk
And with those words the father felt
His entire world falling apart
And he stumbled for the words to express
The tearing inside of his heart
He cried out, why did god have to take her
While she was still so young
And then as if to cut him deeper
Leave this thing here as his son
""please explain to me god's wisdom
How could he decide
To take from me my precious wife
While leaving this alive
There is no reason for this life
Why does he even exist
And if he had never been born
There is no way he'd have ever been missed
If man is made in god's image
Then something here is surely amiss
For there is nothing of god
Nothing of god
Nothing of god
Nothing of god
Nothing of god in this""
And then he asked for the child
To be placed in a state run home
And after he had signed the papers
He walked into that night alone
And in this world he found unkind
He built a wall around his mind
And every year he'd add new parts
Until it had also enclosed his heart
He kept his job and paid his debts
As he slowly became a silhouette
Of a man walking among the tombs
While living his life within his wounds
He distanced himself from all his friends
Even his sisters and brothers
And as time it went by, he developed his eyes
So they could only see the flaws in others
With this final glimpse, the angel stepped away
And the man shook himself out of his trance
Then continued his walk back towards his home
And few would have given his soul half of a chance
And the angel himself felt helpless
As he watched that old man there
So he did what even humans do
And he quickly said a prayer
And as the prayer flew to his lord
The angel did decide
To carefully follow the old man
And stay closely by his side
For on this night can one deny
The gift of a more sympathetic eye
To cast upon our fellow man
And on this night to understand
The frailty of childhood dreams
Like fireflies over summer streams
And if one dared to remove time's veil
Could one retrace those childhood trails?
But whispers in the winter's wind
Told of rescued dreams, forgiven sins
And who among us shall be deemed
To rescue some forgotten dream?
So on this night of christmas eve
As once again the spirits weave
Its snowswept dreams and colored lights
With bits of magic into each life
And as the snow comes gently down
Its soul intent to reach the ground
To cover scars the world still feels
Perhaps to give them time to heal
For as men invest in money
And professors in what they know
God invests in mercy
Like winter invests in snow

In the century where man dies, we the hunters of the hollow hills
Must put ourselves above pity, Above self deception as law
We must be again as once were, We the soul of the earth
As reaping time descends, The sour grain of mercy withers
Into the night we must go, into the darkest abyss
To a level of consciousness unknown to Christendom
We want life, we crush the dream of heaven
As we bring the blade down, one swift move
We are the chosen ones, chosen by will to life
[Verse Two]
You lifeliars crawl on your bended knees
As you finally die, you will eventually have lost more
By not living by the sword than what you lose in death
[Verse Three]
Not by mercy, by strength we end your pity lives
Not by spirit, by flesh we awaken the beast within
Knee deep in your repulsive blood we march
Victorious by the power of our minds and bodies
Watch the twilight of your god
As your system cracks and all your life is dead priest
Take a look into our minds, feel the pulse of omnipotent strength
Take a look into our souls, feel your life drained of everything that was

Your death is sweet

In sheets of rain, I seek out cars
Hands in gloves on handlebars
Ride alone to the pub in the dark

I can't turn back, I make contact
Blinkers smash into a mosaic
And I start flying

Details smash, protect my face

In the majesty of a motor crash
You skid into my darkness forming
Sex and death, heartbreak and strife
Well, they give no warning

'Cause you were there

And rain washes blood now off concrete
People turn away and I just had to laugh

Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed

I want you like Zoloft
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one

I pack no weapon, ya'll ain't worth killin'
Never sold no drugs, but the nigga's who did
A knife in the ribs, music's how I'm speakin' to kids
I wanna live, what the fuck son you think that's wrong?
Just because I don't speak about death in my songs
I'm not the criminal type, but obliterate mic's
Nigga's skills seem so minimal when their wright
?? and criticize everyone on my tracks
If you don't like it, don't buy it, it's as simple as that
Realize that we did it ourselves
We took our own money and put it on the shelves
And now we global nigga's, catch me on live with my man opal
Artists rap all alike that's why they stay local
I'm universal like the label, 
everywhere like I'm NATO
So we make dough, cash prepaid under the table

Born to shine, at home, and over border lines
I seen this kid that used to hold dimes, loadin' a nine
Said that he's rollin' in crime, and it's blowin' his mind
Got radio stations, pumpin' one minute sensations
They wanderin' aimless, with no destination
Claimin' they amazin', but nobody's movin'
If that's what you call game, man your plays need improvin'
The crowds booin' and your the crumb of the year
I see you holdin' your hand out, but I got nothin to spare
You must be buggin' like Chekov with that thing in his ear
Instead of running your mouth, you should be running in fear
I'm just putting idea's and stress down on the paper
And haters don't even like themselves so of course they hate ya
*Shhh* while d-shade ??? ???? ?????? ????? preparing the server hater
We found a plate of leftovers from the last of the challengers
And I mop the stage up with you armatures like janitors
If you got nothin' good to say why bother speak?

Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawer
I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true
You were turning 'round to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes
Now the things that I remember seem so distant, so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all
Although, for a while, our path did seem to climb
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
Although loneliness seems to spring from your life like a fountain from a pool
[Chorus]
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're alright
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
[Verse 2]
Now for you and me, it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And while the future's there for anyone to change
Still, you know, it seems it would be easier, sometimes, to change the past
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at Love's 'Pain and Heartache' School
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you
There's this loneliness springing up from your life like a fountain from a pool
[Chorus]
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight
To keep understanding and compassion in sight
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright",5.0,5.292647900001612

That he grips it so tight

The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring

His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming

Bars in her head

Are staring eye to eye

Never wonder where I am

Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on

Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl

I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound

No one wants a meal that only offers the least

Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese

Then take a look inside my book of recipes (ooo)
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite
I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice (oo ooo)
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable (oo oo oo)
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid (ooo)
When Edna, you look like the whole parade
They say that white has might and thin is in

Sixteen cowboys in an eight dollar room livin' on baloney and beans
Makin' a play for all the buckle freaks in the pretty little tight blue jeans
A cowboy is one hell of a man when he gets bucked off he gets on again
A cowboy is a special breed you leave his hat alone and you leave his women be
From Canada to Houston I guess he tried them all
And it never failed in every bar some redneck started a brawl
But the time and the booze and the broken bones finally put him out to graze
But I'll tell you now he wouldn't change a thing if he could start again today

Tryin' to live on a cow punchers pay
Been changin' them dams in the new summer hay
Irrigating alfalfa for six bucks a day

But the savings are slow to come
On six bucks a day

Out here in the fields while the water runs down
With the sun high above me and the sky all around
I'm dreamin' my dreams of the Canada line
And the places I'd go if the money was mine

Come Saturday night, well, you draw out some pay
Then you go into town just to throw it away
And when the end of the month comes rolling your way
Well, you ain't got much left on six bucks a day

I'll tell you my story
I'd be on my way
But the savings are slow to come
At six bucks a day

Now, if I drew out my time and I paid off my debts
I couldn't get to Great Falls on what I have left
But I've got me no choice when them diesel horns blow
Come a wind from the highway, I got to pack up and go

Yeah, money or none at all they can't hold me this way

Hello Hopsin
Word on the streets is that you're crazy
And I honestly believe you are
[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Listen, if I was really crazy I'd run up inside an orphanage
And torment kids, and beat babies faces with bags of oranges
Fake my origin
 and tell people that I was born to sin
I'd go back to filming molested porn again (Yeahhh)
I would murder a nigga then steal his body from whatever morgue it's in
And take it back to an alley to torture it
Study all of the Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Chuckie horror flicks
(Baby is that a knife that you have in your hand?) Of course it is!
I'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit
And scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)
And tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to
I'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)
Then claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine
And then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics
If I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it
And tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)
[Hook]
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy
[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]
If I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it
I'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas
And blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match
Dig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket
And shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing
I'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle
I cut up within my labor
Take a breather, make a haste of it and bounce
Toward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out
And take em down
Tell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is
Grab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back
Leave it all and still ready me a new blood bath
Run back to the psyche ward
Check my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left
[Hook]
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy
[Verse 3: SwizZz]
Yo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue
But if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do
I'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View
Picturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!
I'll throw babies in dryers
Strangle tweakers that fidgit
Contract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it
I'd mug mothers on wellfare
Swim in gallons of gas
Meander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)
If I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain
Make it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change
Make her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand
Lick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)
Honestly I'd be itching for gunplay
I'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday
I'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway
Grope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!
[Hook]
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me

And divided into 3 quarters
Her children who was fit fell, peace
Battlin', golden', platinum
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed
Pity was not spared for no man, woman, child or rapper
And believe
For his rap was felt by everyone
And this time when trust had no meaning
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decided to the world
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival

To open up a path to reality
For some, judgement

The devil took the straps off my nigga legs
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold
On these streets, anything goes
He was on the road
It took 'em ten to do him in
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks
The reaper came and took him
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him
As I walk through the shadow's of death
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath
The kingdom of freedom is all they said
Why the shackle and chain?

From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride
Bite the apple of eternity (uggggHH)

Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending
Start to finish
Losin' or winnin'
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die?
Now my whole life I was scared
The only judge is god
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill
But I lost to many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death
And even though I never see
I believe there's a god
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy
When times is hard

As the sand slowly poured
I see flashes of life
Time started ticking it's the end of my life
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god
Behold no man or your life destroyed
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom
Big ones and small ones
Good ones and mean ones
As the angel came the ghetto from hell
Some words of peace cuz they didn't know no better
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire
Crosses burned cuz they souls was scarred
Hoping for second chance but ain't none
'Cause it's yo' final call

Life’s greatest questions have always been
Who am I? Where did I come from?
Why am I here? Where am I going?
You are about to see, and hear
One of the most significant messages given to us from God
Get down!
Get down!
[Verse 1]
I'm lying to myself and this dagger's my excuse
I'm a pawn, I should have paid up
And I left an hour late, I was laid up
I must abuse myself
I'm against all that I've made up
Set in stone the sun will come
And I hate the light
You know I hate the light

To me it looks so pretty burning
[Chorus]
Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away
[Verse 2]
I must have caught something
In the heat of all these dances
I'm a worm with no more chances
And I've lost all doubt in a chemical romance
I can't stop itching over thoughts of tarnished hope
Kinda funny lonely feeling I'm not in love
You know it's not love

To me it looks so pretty burning

Burn the light

Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

Girfriend you know how it is
When you got a good man
You start doin' things like wearing those high heel shoes
And the lace pocket with the garter belt
And putting on that sweet smellin' seductive perfume
Hm hmm
But you know what?
I'm gonna have to put some lame brain in check honey
Cause she got her locks on my man
But baby I ain't givin up on this here good thing not for nobody
Cause what that dorky chic GOT wouldn't satisfy a cheese stick let alone my baby
She better take her big long haired butt and move on cause he's mine all mine!
Move On, All All All All Mine!
You used to hold me
You used to feel me
You used to kiss me
You used to touch me
You used to please me
You used to squeeze me
You used to love me
You used to touch me",2.0,2.536603799999284

Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto
[Verse 1: Scarface]
Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane
When all the money stops
I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ask my ma pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam
 to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto
[Chorus: Flaj]
What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto
[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa
, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'mma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rwanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto
[Verse 3: Willie D]
What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
Cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta
Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine
Muthafucka

When you’re riding
Down (at night)
At night
But (you) say
[Verse 1]
The only way to sum it up
Is falling roller-coaster rush
I’m doing things that I don’t do
So comfortable when I’m with you
Kinda took me by surprise
I love it and I don’t know why
You shot it and you got it
And I don’t wanna fight it
So hold me while were taking this ride
[Pre-Chorus]
You, when it's good I'm questioning
You, then I stop to take it in
Is my head in the way?
Cause my heart can't explain
Where we going now?
Build it up, we tear down
Cared before but baby
Now I don’t give a fuck
[Chorus]
All the way down
On a one way to you
I'm on my way down
No matter what you're going through
[Verse 2]
I’m staying over at yours tonight
I'm calling late let’s exercise
There’s something buried in your eyes
Draws me in and I can’t hide
I’m clocking in today I'm on one
I came in hard I hope you don’t run
I tell him all about it but even I would doubt it
They never seen the things that you do
[Pre-Chorus]
You, when it's good I'm questioning
You, then I stop to take it in
Is my head in the way?

Take it in, Take it in
All I wanna do is
Stay with it, stay with it
And I know that you won’t
Play with it, play with it
Are you ready? Hold on
Take it in, Take it in
All I wanna do it
Stay with it, stay with it
And I know that you won't
Play with... hold on

Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five

A wack rapper's what Hopsin isn't, 
I'll kick it
To ya if you got a minute you'll bob ya head like a walking pigeon
Play my position, I'm kinda different when rhymes is kickin'
I got lots of this, I vibe to it as I rock a fitted
The amount of people that's feeling me is a high percentage
They know I'm tight, but I'll be conceited if I admit it
I'ma clown the game until I'm up at the top of it
And don't be chicken to call me out if you got a problem with it
Un-silenced shit is gon' get you stuck in some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so you're better off if you mind your business

She was good for one thing, that was taking a cock

I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with Hop
She's so obese, I'd take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart
Ready to make an assault, she need to make her fucking way to the barn
'Cause that's where she belong, better leave me alone
Calling, asking where I'm at like she need to know
Oh what a surprise, she thinking I'm the love of her life?
Becoming my wife?

Thought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid
I'm a special ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it
'Cause there's evidence to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must've thought I'd never remember the past to it
Fuck school, man, I never could pass through it
I never be that student that headed to class who gets an A
Up on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart
Seem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduate and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me
What do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?
They lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me

But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch shepherd meet shepherd

But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

Like any uncharted territory
I must seem greatly intriguing
You speak of my love like
You have experienced love like mine before

You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

No Achilles heel since I left Philly

Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I'm on the internet, posing as a little girl
I'm tryin' to lure evil into my world
I tell them that I'm curious, and I'm only twelve
Mom and Dad are gone for the day; I'm by myself
Buckets of throw up are next to my computer
Hopin' that they show up, 'cause what I'm about to do to them
Would make the Devil sick.
 I sharpen my blade
Frontin' to this perv like I'm only in the seventh grade
The doorbell rings, I gotta get them inside
In my best little girl's voice I'm like, ""Hi!
Come on in! I'm putting on my bikini!""
And when the door shuts, that's when I let them see me
""Hi there."" (Haha)
 I stab him in the neck first
'Cause it hurts. Hit him where the blood squirts
Carve his whole face off and make him eat it
Chain him up by the foot in my basement, bleeding
[Chorus]
I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
And it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I'm probably gonna burn for this
Ain't no lesson to learn from this
There's nothing I will earn
But it sure is fun (To catch a predator)
I said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)

Soon enough, Feds will be shutting down my service
'Cause people out there think they don't deserve this
Until it's your kid an old man is finger fucking
Titty sucking, then you'll want the knife stuck in
I don't blame you, that's why I catch them in advance
While his dick is still in his pants, they never get the chance
I tell them I'm alone and I'm only thirteen
Looking for a good time. Ya know what I mean?
""Bring me some Funyuns, and a Slurpee
Promise not to hurt me, or give me herpes.""
And within twenty minutes, here comes a fucking doctor
Knocking on my door, a pedophile butt knocker
""Come in! Have a seat!"" and then I stroll in
With the all-purpose hunting blade straight up his colon (Ahh!)
I cut his hands off, he ain't touching nobody
Chain him up by the foot in the basement, bloody
""Pla- pla- please Mr. Clown, sir, you don't have to do this!""
""Zip it!""
""Please! I got money! We ca-""
""Shut it, fucker!""
""Please! We can work this out!""
""Silence I say!""
Stick him next to this other fool. Both left for dead
Every time I walk by 'em, I punch them in the head
Cut they fucking dicks off, stick 'em in each other's mouths
""Now what y'all talkin' about!?""

And it sure is fun (To catch a predator)

""I didn't mean to""
[Verse 3: Violent J]
The house is getting funky, bodies in the basement, stinking
What the fuck am I thinking?
I put my face paint on, go downstairs
And beat they ass sometime, 'cause it ease my mind
Some of them are dead, some are still living
But I'ma hurt them every chance that I'm given
I hit em with the nail gun or the stun gun
They can't run! So, they both mad fun
I was sawing a head off when I heard the doorbell
I'm not expecting any predators, but oh well!
I took my spot. ""Come in! I'll be right there!""
But I left a head sitting on the living room chair!
He seen it and ran! I had to give chase!
We cut across the lawn with my knife swinging for his face!
I threw it, it stuck him in the back of the neck
Still in my drawers, I dragged him home a bloody wreck
""Ahhhh! Somebody! Anybody!""
""Zip it!""
""Stop! Please!""
""Shut it the fuck up!""
""Ahhhhhh!""
""People are looking! Silence!""
A bus full of high school kids watched it happened
He kept screaming like a pansy, despite my slapping
Plus, the neighbors seen it, and so did the mail man
But they all never said nothing bout it again

I'm probably gonna burn for this

Your shelter from the rain
And in the arms of love I'll lift you above all the madness and all of the pain
And you'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love
We search this world for a little copassion
For just one look through the eyes of a child
For one more chance to be a believer
While there's still a chance in time
All your life no one's there beside you
Close your eyes and let this moment find you

Far beyond the brightest shinin' star
Where everything you've waited for is waiting

Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""
Slim Shady, you a basehead

""
Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted

Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
 
While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
And lord how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover
There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrels of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in the fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord what a shock
We nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around - and the poor old dog was drowned
Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover",2.0,3.17592429999786

Because, you lost that glorious grace
You will always be coming back to this place

There's a stranger, pullin' you around
There's a stranger, in our town

And he's gonna break your heart
And then get off on you...
There's a stranger in our town
Pulls out a punk's spinal cord
Piss and blood on the sidewalk of hearts...
This stranger in our town
Lives in tunnels beneath hell
Lives in tunnels way down below your heart...
Push it in and push it out
You already know what it's all about
And you'll be begging as usual without any doubt

There's a stranger, followin' you around
There's a stranger whose in our town (who's)
There's a stranger
And he's gonna break your heart
And then get off on you...

So, I walk smile like he smiles
I walk just like he walks
My right hand to my face like this...
This stranger in our town
He once was in another town
With insects on his face like this...
With names that are just like names
And pictures from the rear of trains
What you want will always be the same

Would you run and find another life to imitate?
It's important that we make the best of short time

Whether you support it or not

It's Cleveland man
[Verse 1]
I am the alpha omega
, 
black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway I’m in airplane hangers
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you, my city’s fatal
Make it up out of it how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D’s the greatEST
I'll light this bitch up make it look like its Vegas
We on, mufucka we on
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinking back when I had a back pack full of fat raps
Didn’t no one wanna hear my song
Mufucka y’all wrong, mufucka y’all wrong
Made it and I never left home
Where I’m from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I’m just a boy in the hood like I’m Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y’all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y’all shits in the ditch like a sewer 
Make all of y’all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas

If you ain’t living your life then you’re dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ahh!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he’d go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I’m the first of a species that they call a real muthafucka, (Kells)
And I’m sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn’t be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I’m a Taurus
That means I don’t give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed
 sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, whats your religion?
I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I’m in your face rippin' this rhythm up like canabalism
Its Kells

She was a country girl born to be free
Who took to the city by chance there to find me

I'm down here listenin' to you

Reminds me of the redwoods and moss covered ground
So if I should wander on back to the coast
Tell her to remember it's her I need the most

You are now listening to the all-time phenomenal
Used to bag work in VA at the Econo Lo'
Now I'm laying out at the Delano though
But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing ""Geronimo!""
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C., ay P, let 'em know!

Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps
 to 
avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like ""Saturday Night Fever""
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, ugh

Laugh and make jokes

You seem so amused
But things would look different
If you were in my shoes
I know it's my fault
But I want out
And when I cry out nobody seems to understand

You don't know how much that hurts
You don't know how it feels to live in your own dirt

There's no certain peace it seems
Desire to keep on moving
Till the river of dreams
Is it just because someone told you
Is it just because you found
Old freedom feels uneasy when duty is around
When allegiance asks the questions
Old freedom twists and turns
And chokes on codes of honour
On the sword of no return
And it's the curse of the traveller
The curse of the traveller
Got a hold of me
And it won't let you be
And in sleepless nights
You'll call her name
And feel loneliness cold to the bone
And when the daylight breaks
This old tired heart aches
To be such a long way, such a long way from home
And you long for the harbourlights
But you'll never be free
Of the craving for refuge
And the call of the sea
Always wanting to sell up
But always needing to buy
So till the road leads to somewhere
And that river runs dry
It's the curse of the traveller
Ain't gonna let you be

Your mama thinkin' you stupid because you bringin' in Fs
Givin' her stress and a couple knots in her chest
Nobody appreciate that you've been tryin' your best
I can show you how to give up and just hang from your neck
Your stepdaddy lookin' for your respect
I say fuck that, don't give it to him, fuck him and his rep
I know he getting on your nerves comin' home drunk as fuck
Beatin' on you and your mama
I say put one that in that llama and spit on him while he's sleepin'
Put a needle in his veins so the police think he was tweakin'
Tell your mama you was gone the whole weekend
Throw away the pistol, make sure nobody could reach it
Your life is better, ain't it? Told you that you need me
I can show you how to be the man
I can show you how to make your body count expand
I can show you how to multiply
Your profits, your pockets, your hoes, follow me and I promise
[Chorus]
I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go
Never listen to your parents, trust me, they don't fucking know what's best for you like I do, yuh, ayy
You think I give a fuck about your IQ?

If you gone drill me come on and drill me
It's all good cuz I got some people to see
While I'm here I'm gettin' full all the time gettin' blunted

A.K.'s and Glocks, in the back the Lexus jeeps
Havin' big baller parties every other week
This is the clique nigga 2-2-6
Black Connection nigga again the code is 2-2-6
Droppin' dope hits, takin' a nigga bitch
While you're on that flight, I'm bustin' nuts in your wife

Don't playa hate cuz we'll still hit'cha block nigga

You could, take it how you wanna, bring it how you feel
My niggas is conscienceless and we kill or be killed
Fuck doin' drive-bys man we do a pull up
The nigga on the passenger side automatically die
From several gunshot wounds to the head
On the scene he dead Chopper City niggas fled
Won't you listen to Ziggy get your car doors bullet proof
It's rainin' choppers so get a bullet proof roof too
You got yay? I don't know it nigga
Nine-six you gettin' nabbed so you best not show it nigga
Cuz that's when you blow it nigga

No bullshittin' nigga my dream is to make a mil
Paper chasin' ain't no fakin' playa haters get killed
Young trill Baby Gangsta into pimpin' them hoes
But before I trick the hoes my money goes to my nose
And fat opthimals, T-shirts and Girbauds
Solja Reeboks straight stickin' to the G-code
Uptown is the home of the car-jackers
Robbers, gangsta rappers, headsplitters and kidnappers

Play wit em, hard head niggas they split em
Raw dope they sell it, I get it I can tell it

You're alone above the street somewhere
Wondering how you'll ever count out there
[Hook]
You can walk, you can talk, you can fight
But inside you've got something to write
In your hand you hold your only friend
Never spend your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
[Verse 1]
When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge
When the words are immobile until you sit down
Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found
Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way
You must really have something
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away
Important to say
[Verse 2]
When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream
And you swear and you curse cause the rhyming ain't clean
But it suddenly comes after years of delay
You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white
Then you can be sure, you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write
[Verse 3]
When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you
But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you
You are wearing your heart on your jumping feet
You've got a head start away from the street
But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen
[Verse 4]
When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune""
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed
Then you stick it together and start writing again
And you know that it won't be too long 'til you're back
To bring her some money, she's calling you ""honey""
Stashed in a bloody great sack
In your Cadillac

I think we need more post-coital
And less post-rock
Feels like the build-up takes forever
But you never get me off
You pull your dress over your face
And I stare down towards my chest
Chastise both our greasy hair
Wonder whose gut is the softest
Stand with my ear to the door
Listening to the landing floorboards
Working out when we'll be safe
To dash from mattress to your bathroom
Where I ball my fingers into fists
Until my knuckles glow bright white
Press the heels into eye-sockets
'Til I see the flashing lights
Stop me when my stories change
When they have started to repeat
'Cause last time I was a mess of sleep
Of icy feet

So baby, all apologies
It was going to happen, inevitably, oh

I think we need more post-coital
And less
 
post-rock
Feels like the build-up takes forever
But you never touch my cock
And what exactly do you mean now
By, ""What can you even eat?""
And how does that affect
How I'll get off this evening?
[Verse 3]
I flew down south to Mexico
Had a minor realisation
I understood why kids draw the sun
With its rays emanating
And the beams broke the clouds
The sky looked like a concertina
I'd sat on in my pocket for weeks
Folded up from a picture
I've been playing Straight Chicken with gay girls
It's never enough
She keeps on pulling the peace sign
And it seems like a taunt
She licked a glaze on her lips
They shone like Battleship Grey
She never liked the wisdom I gave
""Some people give themselves to religion
Some people give themselves to a cause
Some people give themselves to a lover
I have to give myself to goals""
[Chorus]
So baby, all apologies
It was going to happen, inevitably
And if it helps, I mean, even slightly at all
It's best to dust yourself down and get straight back on the horse
[Verse 4]
I condescend a smile and wink
Directly at the camera
I leave you led in both our scents
As I tiptoe out the backdoor
I skid down icy streets and view
My face in the reflection
Of a High Street lingerie store
Though it wasn't my intention
I phone my friends and family
To gather 'round the television
The talking heads count down
The most heart-wrenching breakups of all time
Imagine the great sense of waste
The indignity, the embarrassment
When not a single one of that whole century
Was mine",1.0,1.5268408999982055

Hustlin' in the rain, felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do her (haha)
It's two niggas comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!
[Chorus]
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so-called G's
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that, y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
What's that you drinkin' on?
[Verse 2]
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggas that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers 'til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, ""Son, there'll be days like this.""
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big-time G's
Rollin' in mob cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get tore down for my niggas in the pen', yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love him like one of my own, so you come home
And the years sure fly with a quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be, homie
If you was me, you'd do the shit for me, homie
I can remember scrappin' back to back, throwin' dogs
On them suckers, runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let you know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!
[Outro]
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Look at you, drinkin' got you
Where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga!
It ain't like that, tip that shit over!
Pour out a little liquor!
This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
A little liquor for my homies, y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor!
Young Queen, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
(Pour out a little liquor!)
My nigga Richie Rich, Govenor
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
(I don't care, Night Train, Hennessy)
All my real motherfuckin' partners
(Pour out a little liquor!)
And all my real partners in Marin

fuck you busta-ass niggas!
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go

The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol

Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic

And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it

I miss the old days, tall Chevrolets
Nice tanned up legs swingin' on a tailgate
The old days, when fist fights were fine
Throwin' hands didn't land you two months jail time
The old days, when love was real
And it burned in your soul like a moonshine still
The old days, those days are gone
So I cherish the memories of the place I call home, oh yeah
[Verse 1: Upchurch]
There's a bridge on River Road where I painted my name
With a couple of buddies with John Deere spray paint
We used to smoke on the green after the sun hit the hay
And made it home by nine or daddy's temper would blaze
In them high-school front doors, shit we was straight out the back
Sittin' in a deer stand chewin' Redman up by the pack
Them straight pipes on the 5.7 made us feel badass
Sittin' in the senior parkin' lot crankin' up Johnny Cash
My grades, they wasn't great, but my heart is nothin' but gold
Hospitality's priceless, it ain't 'bout tradin' a soul
So before you judge my cover, won't you dive in my soul
And learn I'm from another life, I'm like 200 years old
[Chorus: Justin Adams]
I miss the old days, tall Chevrolets
Nice tanned up legs swingin' on a tailgate
The old days, when fist fights were fine
Throwin' hands didn't land you two months jail time
The old days, when love was real
And it burned in your soul like a moonshine still
The old days, those days are gone
So I cherish the memories of the place I call home, oh yeah
Oh yeah
[Verse 2: Upchurch]
When I show up to a show, everybody knows I'm fuckin' there
Walk by like I'm stuck in silence, let the folks with cameras stare
I'm there to put my county on, with muddy water in my veins
Countless nights on Indian Springs, prayin' I would catch my dream
When Paw Paw went to heaven, let me tell you, I was lost in life
Almost got fronted them pounds to help keep on my families lights
But then I walked to a church in the midst of the night
Put some tears on the tulips and the creation was bright
And I knew at that very moment the fight I's about to pick involved
Cowboy boots, guitars and not givin' a shit
So let me write to the beat of my two clickin' Tony Lama's
Live in a trailer with my family and a few saved up dollars

MTM, hit 'em with the heat
[Verse 1]
I'm a down south Florida boy, ain't goin' back to Hollywood
From the gutter to your guts, let me ignite the firewood
Still, I roll slow in that Chevy donk, never forget
Where I rose up from, spit on my face, get rid of my funds
And who am I? Just another guy stuck in desperation
Lookin' at the ceilin' fan, spinnin' around, havin' a panic attack
I don't pop no pills 'cause it don't take the pain away from me
I don't crack no seals 'cause it done took the gang away from me
I've been known to pimp a ho, got dirty loafers on my feet
Bitch, you got me mesmerized, them thighs the size of me
Let me slide inside your body beef, bitch
I got my chain on, ain't a thing wrong with a broken frozen wrist

Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But, bitch, I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another

Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But, bitch, I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another

Everything I did is crumblin' beneath my feet
I'm feelin' lonely, feelin' like I'm only stuck with memories
Take me back to what I was, take away what I've become
Take away the grayer days, take the bullet out my brain
Take my dick out your mouth and let me be myself
I wonder what the people around me think about me
Back to my shady ways I go, pack the Gat and let it blow
Just let my lover, brother, mother, sisters, father know I love 'em
Mikey, I told you we was gon' be somethin'
Look at us now 'cause now we buzzin', pressin' buttons
Diamonds dancin' by the dozen
Nick, I told you we would rise from nothin'
Look at the way they look at me now
Rich forever, blowin' money 'til I'm senile

Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase

Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But, bitch, I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
[Verse 3]
I got addicted to the money as I fell inside a hole
The cries and crowd get louder, the deeper that I go
Nobody know what I've been doin', tell myself I hate myself
I can't control the cards I'm dealt
I spent a lot of time alone inside my room
Thinkin' about what I would do if I knew you was on the fence about me too, bitch
I crashed the whip and hit a bitch, and almost killed the bitch
And now I'm back in the Cadillac with that black pistol grip
The AC don't work and I'm feelin' like I was a kid again
Feelin' like I wasn't gettin' in with the cooler kids
How the fuck can I get out of this funk?
If I die, you cry, then move on, the next day
I'm ill-advised, fuck you, bitch, you can't even look me in my eyes

Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But, bitch, I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another

I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

Yeah, about to get my thug on
The 41st side of things
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more, now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
(Yeah, that bitch)
Last name was English and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry
, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap something
Go get your own, don't make me have to fucking clap something
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that something?
To love you, Dainy, more than living itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say, yo P, she only wants you for one thing, that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, acting like she 40 (Word)
She said ""All I need is a man to support me""
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)
And Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearing fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international, think rational
The 12th Street crew, move back when we come through
[Chorus: Prodigy]
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's losing its brain
I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (What, what)
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain
[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Tommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is coming through
, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo
, trying to say he the 
Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack
Got a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, 
caught him North in the Face
All them other kids, they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub, so you know they getting laced
Donna Karan was cryin' 'cause mad shells was flyin'
Damn, all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks 'cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here
Got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut
[Bridge: Q-Tip]
When you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceiving to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, aiyo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by
[Verse 3: Havoc]
My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more cream with the fellas
""Fuck them niggas, spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy""
Then I thought to myself, yo this trick is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin' ""Why you trickin'?, yo, this shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback
[Chorus: Havoc]
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain
[Outro: Prodigy]
To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little somethin' on the floors man
Time to get a little bent, do our thing
Word up, the 41st side of Queens
Getting bent, you know what I mean
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away",1.0,1.5409471000020858

And all because they love themselves sincerely

And he's anxious just to show you what it's for

But take a look outside the nursery door

All running in their sleep, all in a dream
And every loving handshake

You are traveling with me through forests and sands

And you've been taking full advantage haven't you?
Oh, don't say it's true
I lost a friend I'm the saddest again
And we kissed once, even that was in lust
I know you need more than given moments
And sentimental sorries and words only spoken seem lame
And I won't win your heart that way
Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood
Pumping through my veins could freeze
Like the river in Toronto then I'd be pleased

Said I made you feel warm inside

Hold your head up, be strong, c'mon Mary, try.""
I stole mama's car on a Sunday and left home for good
Moved in with my friends in the city, in a bad neighborhood
Charles was a dancer, he loved the ballet
And Kimmy sold pot and read Kerouac and Hemingway
Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in
Charlie and I flipped burgers to cover the rent
And Bourbons at happy hour for thirty-five cents
One day before work we got drunk and danced in the rain
They fired us both
They said, ""Don't y'all come back here again.""
Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams

He never quit nothing and he wanted me to graduate
My brother and sister both play in the marching band
They tell me they miss me, but I know they don't understand
Sometimes you got do, what you gotta do
And pray that the people you love, will catch up with you

Actors and barflies
Writers with dark eyes
Drunks that philosophize

Made up the whole thing, failed when he tried

Broke in and changed 'em, changed as we spoke
We knew that we would always be down

Slipped your head inside the crown

Thought of his friends who slowed to a halt
Who had questioned to no avail
Some knew the answers, some wouldn't tell

Fell through the clouds into the great well
But woke up before he hit the ground

A lousy year for rock and roll
The people gave their blessing to crimes of passion
It was a dark, dark night for the collective soul
I was somewhere out on Riverside
By the 
El Royale Hotel
When a stranger appeared in a cloud of smoke
I thought I knew him all too well
He said: ""Now that I have your attention
I got somethin' I wanna say
You may not wanna hear it
I'm gonna tell it to ya anyway
You know, I've always liked you, boy
'Cause you were not afraid of me
But things are gonna get mighty rough
Here in Gomorrah-By-The-Sea""

It's so damned hot, I can't stand it
My fine seersucker suit is all soakin' wet""

The wind is raging
And the clock strikes midnight
In the Garden of Allah

Nice car.........
I love those Bavarians
.....
so meticulous
Y'know, I remember a time when things were a lot more fun around here
When good was good, and evil was evil
Before things got so.......fuzzy
Yeah, I was once a golden boy like you
I was summoned to the halls of power in the heavenly court
And I dined with the deities who looked upon me with favor
For my talents; my creativity
We sat beneath the palms in the warm afternoon
And drank the wine with Fitzgerald and Huxley
They pawned a biting phrase
From tongues hot with blood
And drained their pens of bitter ink
Vainly reaching for the bottle of empty Edens
Branded specially for the ones
Who had come with great expectations
To the perfumed halls of Allah
For their time in the sun""
We were stokin' the fires
And oilin' up the machinery
Until the gods found out we had ideas of our own
And the war was coming
And the earth was shaking
And there was no more room
In the Garden of Allah
""Today I made and appearance downtown
I am an expert witness, because I say I am
And I said, 'Gentleman....and I use that word loosely...I will testify for you
I'm a gun for hire, I'm a saint, I'm a liar
Because there are no facts, there is no truth, just data to be manipulated
I can get you any result you like....what's it worth to ya?
Because there is no wrong, there is no right
And I sleep very well at night
No shame, no solution
No remorse, no retribution
Just people selling t-shirts
Just opportunity to participate in this pathetic little circus
And winning, winning, winning""
It was a pretty big year for predators
The marketplace was on a roll
And the land of opportunity
Spawned a whole new breed of men without souls
This year, notoriety got all confused with fame
And the devil is downhearted
Because there's nothing left for him to claim
He said: ""It's just like home
It's so low-down, I can't stand it
I guess my work around here has all been done""

Slow down, what you think about a drink?
Mix it with a little bit of sprite though
Ain't you on tour with Dizzy Wright though?
Nigga roll something
You mean to tell me you around all these bomb ass trees
And you don't smoke?
Fuck it, bad bitch wanna hit the blunt, don't mind if I do first
Cool verse, this some new work
Left the hotel, hit the show, God damn, it was too turnt

After that, then another, chilling with my niggas and my brothers
Couple bitches say they with it

Yeah, they all smoke, hit up Cole, tell him that we need some more
Already got Cîroc and the honey jack, little bit of fireball

Step to the line and take hits like the MLB
Let the beat drop while I smoke this weed

Back off tour like what, give it up for the new kid
Nigga I ain't tryna be the new Wiz
I'm just tryna do it like Snoop did
Too clever, whenever, however illegal
When I'm smoking pot up in the parking lot
Hit a lap around the world
Just to land in Amsterdam and smoke a blunt up in a coffee shop
Ain't you smoke like me, nigga
You don't want to see who get the highest, nigga, why you lying?
Nigga, you'll probably get the itis
I just got my marijuana license
She with me, she standing you up
They say I smoke, like I'm at the cannabis cup
Stand on your luck and get handed your face
On a platter with candles and stuff, away
Y'all niggas standing on the sideline
Double X-L fresh
Now I'm headed for the cover of the motherfucking High Times
Pregame before a headline, but it's bedtime for all of these kids
Off that wax, niggas know what it is
She hopped out that cab, just to hop on the dab
And I'm grabbing the torch
 and she grabbing my dick
Let us smoke

And he thought the Indians were some lost thirteen dudes

Into a ditch along the side of the road
And acted like they were drunk
All the time

He'd drive his car at a hundred ten down the alley way
Throwing cinder blocks at trash cans

Will she come back? No one knows

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it 
Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
More and more, I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

Sliced, rolled dice, got shiest on campus

The earth's gravity has pulled me down

HOOK: That's what we need if we gone properly teach / if we gone seek and we gone properly reach (give us the truth) / that's what we need if we gone carry our cross / if we gone effectively disciple the lost (give us the truth) / that's what we need if we gone walk up in holiness and boldness and meek and lowliness (give us the truth) / that's what we need in this race we running / proper lessons as we wait for His Second Coming //
VERSE 2: I left the crib moved into the dorms / so depressed that I ventured in porn it was a crazy thing / I felt the disconnect from Jesus' arms so I ceased to write these rhythms and poems to disobey the King / I told my teachers that I was living in sin and my bible I'd never read it again and threw it in the closet / and anything that had to do with God Marcus T. he was going the opposite as a lifestyle / I called Phanatik and Tonic on the cell and said from ministry that I was gonna chill cause I was in no position / to minister to anybody at all cause I wasn't sure if I was a Christian at that moment dog / I started skipping classes hanging with the masses and my days were black and grey like cigarette ashes / all I know is that I wanted to die but suicide meant meeting the God that I thought forsook me //
VERSE 3: But it was obvious / God in his providence / put me with people to guide me and got me out of this / during the chapel service a cat named Paul Washer preached the gospel and drove me on to the Lord's altar / and I confessed my sin and He pressed reset again / I started over felt like a solider for Jehovah / I called my old pastor and apologized for how I behaved / but as of that day we agreed to go our separate ways / I met this girl named Beth who told me about a church home / first I visit became a member and then it was on / then the pastor gave me a stack of books / now I'm back with raps and hooks / took a summer and spent three hundred dollars on tapes and books and learned from these biblical scholars / now I'm back and I'm walking in light / living my life glorifying Jesus the Christ //",1.0,1.5783983000001172

The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breaking through
To drag us all away
[Verse 2]
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
[Verse 3]
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
[Verse 4]
So we both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
[Verse 5]
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
[Verse 6]
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
[Verse 7]
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
[Verse 8]
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt and my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
[Chorus]
He's alive
Yes, He's alive
Yes, He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive  (He's alive)
Yes, He's alive  (He's alive)
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive, He's alive
Hallelujah, He's alive

Late call, said you were alone
Crying to me about all the things that we said
Apologized for your ways
Said you hadn't slept in days
Said that you need me
And it was just a phase
So I came back, opened my mind
Decided to give you the time
To make it up to me and not turn away
But then again to my surprise
Fooled me once more with your disguise
I should've listened to what my friends had said
All the lies you fed to me
You keep messing with me
You keep messing with me
Promises you never keep
You keep messing with me
You keep messing with me
You said you want me to stay
That I can't leave you, no way
But then you run away when
I come knocking on your door
Suddenly want me to leave
Can't stand to me beside me
Used and abused me
But I won't be coming back no more
Now weeks have passed, you left my side
Left all my thoughts of you behind
No use in being miserable or depressed
Sometimes I see you walking by
But never bother to say hi
Don't want to get caught up in this mess again

You keep messing with me
Promises you never keep

I told you I'd be there for you and I was
And still is the real is who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments and got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy to give you everything
But if you're real then, you can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar, you can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit

Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on the game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

And when you wanna take a flight, I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes, baby

Parading myself as an abductee

From a simple young man
To a godly tomato that held all existence
And told me that we should expand

Oh, that one thought has left my head on a pillow
On my cloud nine

Can connect to my head

Travel the world and the universe as two best friends

Here we go. Can I get a goddamn timpani roll?!
To start this goddamn song? Tonight!
Here's a goddamn song…
For all you goddamn people!
[Verse 1]
Well, the animals laugh from the dark of the wilderness
A baby cries hard in an apartment complex
As I pass in a car buried under the influence
The city's driving me out of my mind
I've seen a child, he's caught in the sad trap of gravity
He falls from the lowest branch of the apple tree
And lands in the grass,
 and weeps for his dignity
Next time, he will not aim so high
Yeah, next time, neither will I
[Verse 2]
Now, a mother takes loans out, sends her kids off to colleges
Her family's reduced to names on a shopping list
While a coroner kneels beneath a great, wooden crucifix
He knows there's worse things than being alone
And so I've learned to retreat at the first sign of danger
I mean, why wait around if it's just to surrender?
And ambition, I've found, can lead only to failure
I do not read the reviews
No, I am not singing for you
[Verse 3]
Well, I stood dropping a coin into the pit of a well
And I would throw my whole billfold if I thought it would help
With all these wishes I make I should buy something real
At least a telephone call home
Well, my teachers, they built this retaining wall of memory
All those multiple choices I answered so quickly
And got my grades back and forgot just as easily
But at least I got an ""A""
And so I don't have them to blame
[Verse 4]
Well, I should stop pointing fingers,
 
reserve my judgment
Of all those public action figures,
 
the cowboy presidents
So loud behind the bullhorn,
 
so proud they can't admit
When they've made a mistake
While poison ink spews from a speechwriter's pen
He knows he don't have to say it so it, it don't bother him
""Honesty"", ""accuracy"" is just popular opinion
And the approval rating's high
And so someone's gonna die
[Verse 5]
Well, ABC, NBC, CBS: Bullshit
They give us fact or fiction? I guess an even split
And each new act of war is tonight's entertainment
We're still the pawns in their game
As they take eye for an eye until no one can see
We must stumble blindly forward, repeating history
Well, I guess we all fit into your slogan on that fast food marquee:
Red blooded, white skinned, oh, and the blues
Oh, and the blues, I got the blues! That's me!
That's me!
[Verse 6]
Well, I awoke in relief,
 
my sheets and tubes were all tangled
Weak from whiskey and pills in a Chicago hospital
And my father was there, in a chair by the window, staring so far away
I tried talking, just whispered, ""So sorry, so selfish""
He stopped me and said, ""Child, I love you regardless
And there's nothing you could do that would ever change this
I'm not angry, it happens
But you just can't do it again""
[Verse 7]
So now I try to keep up, I've been exchanging my currency
While a million objects pass through my periphery
Now I'm rubbing my eyes cause they're starting to bother me
I've been staring too long at the screen
But where was it when I first heard that sweet sound of humility?
It came to my ears in the goddamn loveliest melody
How grateful I was, then, to be part of the mystery
To love and to be loved
Let's just hope that is enough
[Outro samples]
When I woke up this morning...
It sounded like it was getting closer and closer
Look at it, I can't feel it
I opened the doorway and--- huge stairway down to the ocean
...could see this huge--- isn't that weird?
I like to hang out with people...
...accepted it
Hi, Conor. It's Timmy... hoping that we were still gonna record that song tomorrow... called you over the weekend but...
...gravitational pull...
I'm not worried about it",2.0,3.8488368000034825

Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout ""We"" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now
[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]

Come and see me for once

Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't
(Yeah, I thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once

Pride killed everything when it rose up
Ate it from the inside out like ulcer

Rep for the one that hung no poster
I got a weapon for the war no holster
Never ever get pulled off to the shoulder
FACT he remain the same, and he said that we reign
So adapt to terrain like you soldier

Book of yall life so the page won't fold up
Cost of a soul do you know what I Go For?
You can walk away but the whole won't close up
Still gotta a void and you're only getting older
Lost in this world every day getting colder
Me turn anyway from the king PSSST no sir
Are you listening? Haddy told ya
I won't stop
We walk through these doors that won't lock
The last I checked my lord was on top, to smash on that la vida loca
We won this game in the lead with no shots
He helped me keep this clean wit no spots
Finna run up in the spot given Glory to God
No one dead or alive can make me stop!

Never really been afraid of the enemy I'm ready for the war now
Finna mash that gas won't slow down, won't die hopes high ready when it goes down
Till the enemy camp is a ghost town, ima swing get him in a ring 24 rounds
Matter fact Christ said just lay low, till ya get him, I already hit him with K.O
Yo, it ain't no stoppin what He's ordained, this is Gods property we stomp until they floor cave
My Lord reign, blood of Christ drippin from my door frame
No Idol fornication we are not here foreplay
No matter what weapon is formed we weatherin the inevitable storm
Better be ready to carry you're metal you not in that Word you're left with no sword

Always open up a window
Even death can't break you
Word to the facial
To overcome the pain that men know!
You stoppin lookin
We keep it poppin
I follow Jesus… no people watchin
He Hold ME Up, im bound to drop it
He paid it all…. I split the profits…

Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

The black rims align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, we shake it out
Lace our boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him
And said now boy, now you own me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes
Tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight
Can't hit those brakes, 
this is what you wanted, huh?
But you got it all in vain
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name
It goes...

Let me ash my issues
Ashtray as this asphalt
American spirits
, 
black coffee
Conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Than when you pictured it on that back porch
And I'm gone
World traveller all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another, and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah, free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light
And guess who tried it
, 
shit, I'm blinded
By this lime light, this lime light
It's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on you can't walk away
Don't die here
, 
don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared, I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids close, life turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

He knew life was just a gamble
So he lived from day to day without a care

About Butcher and Fast Eddy
Across the river lived Fast Eddy
He was known to be treacherous, very mean
Even Eddy's sweet young sister out on the streets
Just a girl, barely fifteen

And he claimed he was better...than most
One day I'm gonna fix that Butcher
Always seemed to be this cocky braggart's boast
There's only the quick and the dead
I wanna know who's layin' down
Now, I'm gonna win this fight said Eddy
Yeah...'cause I'm gonna take a knife, and I'm gonna take a gun
But Butcher, he told his mates as they gathered 'round
I got two good fists, and you know I never...
Never ever ever been afraid of anyone
And it came the night, at last for their meeting
I can't lose said Eddy, 'cause I'm the best
But the cold light of morning found Eddy
His own switchblade knife...buried deep in his chest!
Yeah that's it all....Oh-WOW Butcher, and Fast Eddy
Yeah that's it all
And the law never did touch Butcher
And I'm so glad, 'cause I know so well
He was born with a wild free spirit, and he never...
He never was the kind that could live locked up in some dirty stinkin' cell
And the kids, they still talk about it
In the back streets and alleyways around town
They still talk about that cold, windy Saturday night that

Here’s to us
FRANK
Who’s like us?
CHARLEY
Damn few
FRANK
Hey, old friend
Are you okay, old friend?
What do you say, old friend
Are we or are we unique?
Time goes by
Everything else keeps changing
You and I
We get continued next week
Most friends fade
Or they don’t make the grade
New ones are quickly made
And in a pinch, sure, they’ll do
But us, old friend
What’s to discuss, old friend?
Here’s to us —
Who’s like us?
Damn few!
CHARLEY
So, old friend
Fill me in slow, old friend
Start from hello, old friend —
I want the when, where and how
Old friends do
Tend to become old habit —
Never knew
How much I missed you till now
ALL THREE
Most friends fade
Or they don’t make the grade
New ones are quickly made
Some of them worth something, too
But us, old friends —
What’s to discuss, old friends?
FRANK
Tell you something
Good friends point out your lies
Whereas old friends live and let live
MARY
Good friends like and advise
Whereas old friends love and forgive
FRANK
And old friends let you go your own way —
CHARLEY
Help you find your own way —
MARY
Let you off when you’re wrong —
FRANK
If you’re wrong —
CHARLEY
When you’re wrong —
MARY
Right or wrong, the point is:
Old friends
Shouldn’t care if you’re wrong —
FRANK
Should, but not for too long —
CHARLEY
What’s too long?
FRANK
If you’re wrong —
CHARLEY
When you’re wrong —
MARY
The thing is:
Old friends do leave their brands on you
But old friends shouldn’t compete
FRANK
Old friends don’t make demands on you —
CHARLEY
Should make demands on you —
FRANK
Well, don’t make demands you can’t meet
CHARLEY
Well, what’s the
Point of demands you can meet?
MARY
Well, there’s a time for demands
Whether you meet them or not…
ALL THREE
Hey, old friends
How do we stay old friends?
Who is to say, old friends
How an old friendship survives?
One day chums
Having a laugh a minute
One day comes
And they’re a part of your lives
New friends pour
Through the revolving door —
Maybe there’s one that’s more
If you find one, that’ll do
But us, old friends —
What’s to discuss, old friends? —
Here’s to us!
Who’s like us?

Well worn memories of days gone by
Needing someone and nobody's there

Another nightime that just never ends
A helpless longing for what might have been
Another morning to face all alone

They go on and on

With dreams just like a style
She floats on through the sound waves
And plays in them a while
Like a million tripping daisies
Just dancing oh so lazy

Why do you get to feeling so low oh oh no?

You didn't have nothing good to light up you way
You put it down
That stone cold taxman's face
And if you wanna put a smile on everyone's face
For the love of the music

I searched around my head
Even looked under my bed
Where the roaches and the dust mites laid
Found a dirty shirt instead

But you know the coolest thing, is that you don't stink
You stay clean for the love of the music in your brain
But you can't just keep it
I like the way
And I like you for yourself to play

I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I 
go across
 and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up",6.0,7.608113299997058

I've been tracing your steps
Along with your dainty, exquisite guest
Across mountain land and serpentining seas
These two have been on quite an odyssey
You're a fool to think this princess
Could ever really love a couple of poor boys like us
She requires riches, 
recherché
Riding with 
rodomontading
 
roués
[Adakias]
Casanovas have charmed with chiffons, so 
chichi
Chased her with their conceited coteries
[Anhura]
Maharajahs
 have 
magniloquently
 mouthed
Their love for me through their menageries
[Adakias]
She's been propositioned, propounded, by every pompous prince
Given 
panniers
 of peerless pears and plums, polished
[Anhura]
I've been seduced with shimmering, sparkling stones
Squired
 by suitors to sizable 
chateaus
[Adakias]
And I'm the one she chose!
[Pallis]
I understand how you can love a man of truth
So why don't you just ask him where he spent his youth?
Oh, look at her face!
She really doesn't see that you are from the dark
And you've been lying through your teeth
[Adakias]
Anhura, please listen, I really can explain
I meant to tell you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
Now you know the truth, but that knowledge
Shouldn't change the nature of our love
We've broken through the chains
[Pallis]
I'm sure that she would care to hear your 
acumen
As to how your presence is the reason she is sick
But I suppose it's in vain, since her life is ending
When I thrust this blade into her heart-a-thumping!
[Adakias]
Brother, NO!
[Pallis]
Brother, what have I done?
My blade has pierced your side
This was never my intent
Oh God, please stay alive!
[Adakias]
Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You've tried to protect me
But your dagger's edge finding my flesh
It truly was my destiny
[Pallis]
Brother, I was shortsighted
I ignored your cries
You really are the chosen one
The calculated sacrifice!
[Adakias]
Please listen to my last words
Before I fade away
This is my gift to you:
Live for your love every day
[Pallis]
Please don't let your tired heart stop beating
You're bleeding
Just keep breathing
[Adakias]
You will take care of this 
spinning sphere
I'll disappear and see you in the mirror
Place your hand on mine
, one last time, and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind, before I die
Place your hand on mine, one last time, and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind, before I die
Please don't cry
[Narrator]
The mountains seceded
The light and dark depleted
We lost Adakias, but 
regained our science
Our world was finally reunited
So this is my cue of where to leave you
Now it's your story to retell and pass on
Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon
So remember, never surrender

Where dock worker's dreams mix with panther's schemes to someday own the rodeo

Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs
Oh, Rex said that lady left him limp, love's like that (It sure is)
Oh, queen of diamonds, ace of spades, newly discovered lovers of the everglades
They take out a full page ad in the trades to announce their arrival
And Mary Lou she found out how to cope, she rides to heaven on a gyroscope

Before this jam starts I'm simply stating
You have all waited, now you can stop waiting
Shall I ease into the disses, go 20, then 30
Or shall I got straight to 80 percent?
Aw, it doesn't matter, when you're dissed, you're dissed
The party's not over, it's just beginning
Because Lyte is winning (What are you winning?)
Any battle in any competition
'The Gangstress'? Ha, you're on a wack journey
(Ho) Headed for nowhere, with time to spare
So I'ma kick this rhyme right now and right here
I'd tell your name, but that would give you fame
And I ain't out to give you what you don't have
So I sit back and relax, cause it makes me laugh
I could diss, call you names and make fun of you
(Ho) But me the Lyte, I'm into speakin the truth
Like a watchtower, hour by the hour
Lyte is rhymin, perfect timin
Milk keeps the beat (I keep the beat)
With the tap of his feet (With the tap of my feet)
When he count it down (When I count it down
6-7-8) Lyte'll start the debate

[ VERSE 2 ]
The first thing you ask yourself is why do I bother?
When you should really ask: where is the father?
(Where is the father?) of your child, aren't we wild?
You get around like a cab, now that's too bad
Everyone has been in you, isn't that sad?
Bodily you're vivacious? Don't make me laugh
Weight Watchers is waiting, here's a free pass
You ain't gettin loose, you fuckin jerk
And you ain't gettin paid, you're just gettin laid
Sexin and suckin, yeah, that is your trade
Put on this earth just to distract me
Get those to write rhymes and try to attack me
You will get nowhere, the Lyte is too blinding
Tell me, why must I keep reminding
You to step back, let the Lyte shine
Do not say shit till you write your own rhymes
[ Chorus ]
[ VERSE 3 ]
Your mold is fake, crayola, crayon
Don't dare to sleep or even prey on
The Lyte is too wicked, too worthy, too strong
And the rhymes I create are made to last long
Let me wise you up, rappin isn't a sport
You either have to teach yourself, or you have to be taught
And being that you are not wise enough to do it on your own
The ones that write your rhymes might as well hold your microphone
Dropped a little vinyl, now you think you're large
Step aside, Lyte Thee MC is in charge
Don't sleep on me, I'm far, far, far from dumb
So roll correctly if you decide to come
MC sucker, this is what you waited for
I'm sick of the battle, let's go to war
Why do you challenge me, Lyte Thee MC
Did not you know that I am crazy?
My screws are quite loose, in fact I don't have any
But when it comes to rhymes, I've got many
Like I said and will have to say
Over and over, cause you disobey
Here on this earth I reign superior
One of these days I will have to get with ya
Tear you up mentally, from limb to limb
Cause I am the Lyte, and you are just paperthin
[ Chorus ]
[ VERSE 4 ]
I sensed it, predicted it, knew it would happen
You plopped off fast on the scene and start rappin
Now it is my duty, to all MC's
To ask you to go elsewhere, pronto, please
Now I was quite polite, nice I might add
But you insist on stayin, that makes me mad
But then again I don't mind, I've got someone to pick on
Write rhymes to diss and even play tricks on
You ain't really down, 
you wig-wearin clown
Borrowin money to buy an outfit
Not even good enough for a Sunday picnic
I ask you: do you know who you're fuckin with?
With those Bubblegum jeans and those 2-for-1 Skips
I'm MC Lyte a.k.a. MC Payback
Payback is a bitch,
 and I'm givin you no slack
Unfinished Business, that shit was wack
So Lyte made no attempt to strike back
But here we go again, what is Light's Out?
Let me ask what the bomboclut you a-chat about?
Let me say next time that you feel pissed
I suggest that you don't try to diss
[ Chorus ]
[ VERSE 5 ]
You better watch what you say to me, cause I can get evil
The things that I'm capable of are unbelievable
In 10% I popped your head in a microwave
I'm into blenders now, so you better behave
Or put you in a toaster, because you're gettin toasted
Better yet an oven, because you're gettin roasted
Don't listen to your rhyme writers, cause yo, they souped you
You ain't dope, you can't cope, they musta dooked you
You musta had some wack crack (real wack crack)
Sent you on a mission, and now you're comin back
But let me school ya, Lyte is runnin this show
So yo, ho, I think you oughta go
Before Lyte Thee MC gets into it (into it)
But remember, you forced me to do it

Yo, now you know
And knowing is half the battle

We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(
Shaytan
 got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

So frame this 
Kodak black
, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch-hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spittin
With raw poppy, and now your first love is 
krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whipped cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I'll be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is

Anytime we're in stalemate, a final bowing
[Pre-Chorus 2]
My tendency to want to hide away feels easier and
The immediacy is picturing another place comforting to go
[Chorus]
The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately
[Bridge]
We could just walk away and hide our heads in the sand
We could just call it quits, only to start all over again
With somebody else
[Verse 3]
Every time we're stuck in struggle, I'm down for the count that day
Every time I dream of quick fix, I'm swaged
Now I know it's hard when it's through and I'm damned if I don't know quick fix way
But formerly mistreat me silence now outdated
[Pre-Chorus 2]
My tendency to want to run feels unnatural now
The urgency to want to give to you I don't want most feels good
And I know
[Chorus]
The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll get better
The only way out is through ultimately",2.0,2.6620545999976457

Wake yo' punk-ass up for the '93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin' house, gyeah
And it ain't nothin' but a Compton thing, y'all
And we ain't nothin' but Niggas On Tha Run
And this goes out to my niggas, gyeah
[Verse 1]
A fucked up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Hmm, somebody help me
But nah, they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin', 'cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got Moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas puttin' brew in my fuckin' baby bottle
Damn! And through all the motherfuckin' pain
They done drove my moms insane
So, I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah
[Hook]
Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace
[Verse 2]
Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder
That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under
Gyeah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' (Japs)
See a bitch in the right lane, so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
Sayin': ""Play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!""
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers
And my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah, motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah
[Hook]
Uhh, whassup, y'all?
Streiht up menace
Damn!
Really, really
Streiht up menace
Damn!
[Verse 3]
I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'you can get the fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay, 'cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do?
The homies say: ""The hood's where it's good
Homeboy, I thought you knew.""
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, gyeah

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world

Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed,
 they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

The dogs of war won’t capitulate

And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain

Ooh, ah, hey
Hey
Ooh, ah
Hey
[Verse 1]
He comes from a foreign place, an island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless, can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance to the rhythm of the band
I feel his fingertips grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss
[Pre-Chorus]
Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers
She said, ""I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother""
I said ""Ay mama, you seem to forget I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over""
But I realize big brown eyes can hypnotize when he says
[Chorus]
""I am full blood boricua""
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Oh)
He tells me, ""Mami, I need ya""
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (Oh)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, ""Te quiero, te quiero""
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation
[Verse 2]
Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within' (Melt within')
Feels so good, it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started, I'm givin' in (Givin' in)
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me (Inside of me)
Finds the words when I cannot speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Mama used to warn me not to rush love with another
She said, ""I'm not trying to lecture, I just care about my daughter""
""Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let a man control my emotions""
But when he smiles (When he smiles)
I feel like a little child when he says
[Chorus]
""I am full blood boricua""
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Whoa, oh)
He tells me, ""Mami, I need ya""

Caught between my mama's words and what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world, but part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it? Can't resist it

Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico?
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight

Nothing could stop them when Jables and Rage hit the stage
And Hollywood Jack hit the big time and went to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams
And he grumbled and growled and watched Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
He burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doing mushrooms
""Fuck him! I don't need no Hollywood Jack, anyway!""
So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
And Rage Kage lived deep in the broiling valley below
Yes, the Rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground and he looked on the stage
The lava was flowin' and broilin' inside the old Kage
As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out and he'd make even more millions
He'd screen KG's calls and snort coke off the ass of a whore
No one respected him, they just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams, he would cry and he'd rage
For the stage
[Flute solo]
Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They sent Kage away cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jet plane
And flew all that night through the rain
To be with his friend, and see what remained of his brain
Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors, ""You've got to retrieve him
You've got the technology, use the techniques of your trade""
He grabbed their lapels and he screamed, ""By God, you must save him!
Because Rage Kage and I, can't you see, that we're one and the same?""
Rage Kage
Oh, Rage Kage
There be magic inside that old name
And you know
That you know
When you're going completely insane
Ah, the Rage Kage
Ah, the Rage Kage
Oh, the lion will roar once again
And you know
Yes, you know
When you're going completely insane
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again...
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again...
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again...
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again...
Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again...

What's happening? Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I'll back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas X'ed out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home *Bell rings*

Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it

I bleed, kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness

For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking

And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out

A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
""Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far""
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins

While mortals sleep, the angels keep

Where meek souls will receive Him still

Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow

Turn her heart of gold to steel

And I've been dreaming like a child
Since the cradle broke the bough

One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in
[Verse One]
Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin, flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, cause..

It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love
[Verse Two]
Now girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Now fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin that a girl posess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

Damn your baby tall, what you been up to?
I don't blame you my doll
Yeah, we kinda stalled
As God as my witness, timin' was my mistress
I guess it's in the stars for me to love you from a distance
Ah, our ship sailed, ah, the wind blows
The door's always open but our window is closed
You always thought ""What if?""
But that'll just drive you crazy baby, girl interrupted

Thinkin' 'bout what was it?

[
Verse 1: Prodigy
]
You's a notebook crook, with loose leaf beef
A backseat criminal who pass the heat
To somebody that blast the heat
Man, it sound bad on the pad, what happened in the street?
A villain on the vinyl; an analog outlaw
A lot of gats on your DAT, taped southpaw
You thuggin' when the mic's plugged in
Barkin' through the speakers like you got no sense
You wild on the two inch
Got your platinum plaques to prove it
Your music's been around the world movin'
And it comes right back around to the ground, don't it?
Now it's time to face your opponent
Infamous cling to this real shit, stuck where we started at
Fuck that, not because I have to, we want to
I love this shit, the raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Wylin' on the dancefloor
When they song come on, swingin' they fists, ready for war
But it's a different type of effect, it's not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranqu'ed by the sound bank
Put under the drum, numbed off of our shit
Now who you rockin' wit'? Them or us?
Deep love or cheap lust? QB or bust
Infamous 'till we pass on
You laughing at the wrong shit, I take action
Defend my confidantes
Nigga, I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of being top dog
As we move through the stage fog
I need to bass more
So I can taste it 
and make ya'll go AWOL
And lose it, say no more, brace your delf, nigga it's on..
[Verse 2: Cormega]
(yo, back up yo..)
Whose tale you tellin'? Are you frail or felon?
Were you makin' sales or watchin' niggas sellin'?
You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid 'em
You never felt the moisture in the air of coke boilin'
You never felt the razor scrapin' your plate
Your hands achin' yet you keep choppin' cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility
Clutchin' a gun like, fuck it thun, it's him or me
At your best you was a hand-to-hand
No more than three grams
What the fuck you know about a ki', man?
You never hustled
Let's get it right, my nigga Y would've stuck you
Stop dry snitchin' in your rhymes, listen
What you tryin' to do? Help the guys in blue?
Indict thuns so that can be another rhyme for you?
You a parasite
, you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
It's clever when you write it
Spoken well for a dude who never been indicted
You know the deal mothafucka, the real make the fake niggas kneel
And lose appetites when you taste niggas steel
My rhymes are what it takes to get a deal and make it real
I'm like Big, you can't replace the skill,
 
I laced it ill
Like cocaine in Scarface's grill
Your mothafuckin' flow is basic, chill
I'm Cormega, raw forever
Y'all niggas know my steez, I'm reppin' for Queens
You minor league
I'm big time like Mark McGwire's team
Your whole team is pussy, when I squeeze, vaginas bleed
My lyrics stay official
I bagged up coke on dishes made of crystal
Your niggas, they will miss you
My nickel-plated pistol got sixteen shots, you can take 'em with you
To the coffin or DA's office
Surgery, nurses screamin', ""We lost him!""
Life suddenly divorced him
Fuck it, it cost him
If you want beef, say no more
Brace your delf, nigga it's on, we spray Four-Fours, bitch!",10.0,12.376383700000588

Pardon me.  Can I have a word with you for a few minutes?
Sit down, get comfortable
Uhhh, how long have we known each other? About 10 months? Yeah I think its, yeah. You and John are real tight aren’t ya?
Yeah.  Oh is that an engagement ring?
Awww, congratulations
Oh he slipped it on your finger last night huh?
He’s the luckiest man in the world, you know, he should be real proud to have someone like you
Oh yeah, umm, what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, there is something that has been bugging me for about 5 months and I’ve been carrying it around with me and it’s getting heavier and heavier everyday…
And, uh, yeah it’s almost to the boiling point and I have to get it off my chest
Yeah, I’m not trying to be fresh or anything, because I know you're John’s girl, but I just have to tell you this
You see I have a great deal of respect for you…I’m not being, you know, not going left field on you …but dig
You see I’m gonna take you back to my childhood for a minute….We had quite a big family and we weren’t very rich, sometimes we lived from day-to-day
But one thing we did do was go to church every Sunday.  Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school
She taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, “Son do onto others as you have them do onto you”, she said “Don’t steal” “Don’t rob” You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children
Well you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once
And umm, she said “Stay out of trouble” You know when I was a teenager I didn’t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody
I tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest.  Didn’t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait,  huh ’til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court
But you know….sometimes you’re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can’t get out the way, you know?
And you can fall and the more you, it’s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink
I’m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I’m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say
See there is a lot of talk going around town that I’m on the make for John’s girl, “Ike’s on the make for John’s girl”.  I don’t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn’t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me
But you see I’ve never seen anybody like you, I’ve never known anybody like you, and there’s some things you just can’t help.  At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see….I find myself thinking about you
I just can’t help it, and right now……
I stand accused
Of lovin' you too much
And I hope, I hope it's not a crime
'Cause if it is, I'm guilty
Of lovin' you, you, you
I, I hope to God
That I never have, oh, to testify
'Cause if I do
Everyone is gonna, they're gonna cry
They're gonna say
Old Ike is guilty
Of lovin' a sweet girl like you
I know, I know
You belong to another
I, I may not stand a ghost of a chance
I'll stand on top of Mount Everest
And proudly tell the world that I love ya
Oh yes, I will
Because I, I just can't
I can't help myself
I'm a victim of circumstance
And just one
Ooh, one touch of your hand
I don't know how it happened
But just look at me
I find myself chillin'
On the witness stand
And I'm shoutin' out
All over, all over the land
Everybody, I'm guilty
I'm guilty of lovin', lovin' you
I'm guilty of lovin' you
I said, I'm guilty
But what can I do?
I wanna hold ya
I wanna squeeze ya tight
But my mind said
She belong to another
And that ain't right
(Album version cont.)
...
I didn't ask to fall in love with you
I just couldn't help myself
And now I'm strung out
Don't know what to do, no, no, no
I'm guilty
Of lovin' you
Oh yeah, I'm guilty, of lovin' you
I'm not ashamed to say I love you, I love you, I love you
I can't help but, I just can't help but.. love you
And I'm guilty baby
Oh I'm guilty
I know you belong to another
But I can't help, I can't help but love you
Oh yes I do
I stand accused of loving you
Baby, baby, baby
Please, can't you understand, the situation that I'm in
That's ~a~ one side of love, man",1.0,2.585436599998502

I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean

Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw,
 
but I swear it is sweet

Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

Guru

Yo yo Gu-rizzi, yo
Yo whassup son?
Yo man, youknowhatImean? I need this money man
Get up out in these, in these streets man
Yo, so what's the deal God?
I'm sayin, what you need though?
Yo let me have like, two or three, three G's man
I'm sayin, I'm sayin son man
You know what happened last time though
I gotta do what I gotta do man, I gotta eat man
Whassup man? Oh your baby momma stressin you?
Way past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you...
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin your thing, sewin shit up on the block
You need to stop, fore you get caught again
Or you get shot and I lose another friend
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes
Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies
Cause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out
And they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust
It's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""

The warmth of
Days gone by

But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional

The type that claim their fly and fresh
Yappin like hoes bout who got the best Rolex, sweat
Drenchin' all on my head and my shirt
It's time to shake my buzz, grab a skirt and go to work
Crack the dance floor wit' me but don't hurt yourself
Nights in the summertime at the club (oh yeah)
The tricks come to spend a lot
On these tricks off the knot
That's why they get with pockets ripped to they socks
Damn! These pretty hoes comin' in flocks
Talkin' 'bout how many freaks I got
That's why I go sometimes for a minute then I shake the spot

And then he looks over in the Amen Corner
All the sisters commenced to shout (What'd he say?)
He said
[Refrain]
""A married man's a fool to think that his wife
Will love nobody else but him""
She stick by you all of your life, the chances is mighty slim
[Verse 1]
Now you read the Good Book, chapter 21:
Every married woman got to have a little fun
Read on over chapter 22:
It's a sin to let that woman make a fool outta you
Now you read a little further, chapter 23:
She two-time you, brother, like she double-crossed me
Read on back, over chapter 10:
Shimmy one time, you got the problem again 'cause a
[Refrain]
'Cause a married man's a fool to think that his wife
Love nobody else but him
 
I mean
Love nobody else but him
[Guitar solo]
[Refrain]
Well, a married man's a fool to think that his wife
Will love nobody else but him
She stick by you all of your life, the chances is mighty slim
[Verse 2]
Now you read on over to 25th page:
Married women's, Lord, is hard to engage
Read kinda careful, chapter 26:
Back door slamming, you got to learn to get it fixed
Read on out, chapter 28:
Who's that backslidin' out through your back gate?
I believe I'll close on chapter 29:
Woman get tired of the same man all the time
[Refrain]
'Cause a married man's a fool to think that his wife
Will love nobody else but him
I mean will love nobody else but him

And you only call me when you see me pourin' up
And you snuck and told, you don't know if we know or not
And you brought me drinks, only time you threw a shot (Woah)
My other homie told my other homie
That my other homie other homie tryna kill him
That's why I only fuck with a couple niggas
Get out the dope game, get a couple figures
Make my bitch cum and then I'm cummin' with her

But look around

And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside's

Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime

And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

We done came up
Everybody love ‘em

Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G,
 
fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga,
 
basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures,
 
don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - 
let me guess: that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em,
 leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya
[Verse 2]
It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Boss-man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland,
 
but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends

It seems like I always knew this
Since I'm a child, I can feel it

Extended wings I'm flying
Over the valleys and planes
The curve of space I'm leaving
Death is just an illusion

Dig a tunnel for light through ignorant walls

Grow up with impatience, I'm falling down

Rediscover life while I'm breathing
Designing the shape of material
Frozen icon distant reminder
Mankind has forgotten the gateways

His daddy owned a ranch outside of Clairmore
Where he learned to ride before the age of three
Now young Will Rogers was a cowboy
And he practiced with his rope most everyday
He'd ride around the barn or cross the prarie
And threw a rope around any thug that came his way
Yes Will Rogers was a country boy one of Oklahoma's favorite sons
The nation clamied him as their pride and joy
But his roots were deep in Oklahoma sod
Before too long he had his fill of schooling
At eighteen years he got the urge to roam
A whole great big world wass out there waiting
So he saddled up and lit out on his own
Well he wrangled some ranches down in Texas
And he punched some cows out in New Mexico
Then he nearly starved to death in Argentina
In Africa he joined a wild west show
Yes Will Rogers...
From the early days of Vaudeville to the big time
Folks that knew him said that he'd never change
He was still the simple Oaklahoma cowboy
No matter what he always stayed the same
I suppose most of all he loved the people
Said, he never met a man he didn't like
When times were hard and folks were feeling sorry
A word from Will would always bring a smile

There's a hole in the wall

(Has implicated you in high treason)

To take you through
To take you through

[Verse 3]
Hey, babe, where will you go when that hole in
The wall is shut?
Woah, babe, you know where I'll be when that
Hole in wall is shut
We were such an ugly pair
The chameleon twins, they'd stop and stare
Lovers know when love has gone
A black hole there where love was once the end

Ooh, a hole in the wall
There's a hole in the wall
Catch it before you fall
The hole in the wall

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

Would you love me, baby
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

If Da Brat gave a fuck about a nigga
My heart would be broke
Shoulda known you were star struck

But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again
I'm a fool when you smile at me, I'm convinced
I get caught in you and I just can't resist
I know you lie to me

You set it up, impress me with gifts and rings

Panned the gold out of its rivers irrigated desert valleys

Shovelin' in the overhangs
Siftin' off most my days
For a 
B-1 bomber
 that'll blow your mind
Listen for the sound of glass
Huntin' someone else's knap
For a B-1 bomber from Flint knapptime
Then all of a sudden
I'm watching it leave
Off the ground and into Hawkeye's pocket
[Verse 2]
Squash biscuits and a broke leg stream
Flying saucers in my huntin' dreams
In the center of the shuttle I can hear a banjo break
Happens every now and then
If you're lucky they will let you in
If you show on time and you show up straight
As a walkway is folding
Gettin' ready to leave
Hawkeye waves goodbye and decides to smile
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Knee-high to a cricket
And younger than me
Covered up in fancy rocks and relics
[Verse 3]
Wit sharper than a green flint spear
Hits hard enough to fall a deer
Oh dear, I swear I fell, it's true
Lips of imperial red
Rock of ages in my river bed
I have no earthly jewels for you
Coming home empty-handed
But I finally see
Covered up in fancy rocks and relics",2.0,2.979845200003183

Grind on 10, be home in a minute

I learned to play the flattop on them good old Gospel songs
Then I heard about the bar rooms just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a living playing guitar late at night
Had to learn about the ladies, too young to understand
Why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away
To some other guitar picker in some other late night place
Yeah, held on to my music, I let the ladies walk away
Took my songs and dreams to Nashville then I moved on to L.A
Up to New York City all across the USA

You were born to, take the greatest flight
Like a serpent and a dove, you will have wisdom born of love
And carry visions from above into the places no man dares to follow

Waiting for the light
Take the flame tonight

Upon the sacred path you keep, leading deeper into the unveiling
As your sailing, across the great divide
Like a wolf at midnight howls, you use your voice in darkest hours
To break the silence and the power, holding back the others from their glory

I wish I was a riot grrrl, feminazi punk
Not your average ordinary day job girl
I won’t take your abuse
Quit acting like a bitch and making up excuses
Girl, hanging with Bikini Kill
Female empowerment fills up the room I'm in
A never ending movement
All of these things make me wish I was a riot grrrl
I wish I was a riot grrrl, that would be cool
Taking what you know and breaking all the rules
Screaming in your face till your ears get tender
Teaching you a thing about race and gender
I’d like to kick your ass
Yeah that sounds fair
Hiding my brutality behind dyed hair
Men with guitars they don’t know shit
And if they wanna talk shit they can meet me in the pit
Girl, hanging with bratmobile
If i can’t hit those high notes, i’ll just squeal them
Into the crowd, its where i belong
Undercover feminine punk rock
Called riot grrrl
Riot grrrl",5.0,7.535283600002003

One hundred thousand years of dreaming, drowned in a flood of fear and greed

As the ground beneath our feet turns to dust
The air we breathe laced with poisons
A legacy of disgust, a legacy of sorrow

Back in January, nah, chill.....it was December
True...cuz that's when L started his bid
Partied through the New Year, January third he slid
Up until then, yo, L had it swell
Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell
He did the job, money came with ease
Blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
Him and his bitch, in forty-G rides
Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air), toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
My niggas fiend, I'm abouts da beamer
Think about your bitch cuz yo fuck it I'm a dreamer
Called up CRU, yo, they probably in the studio
Phil Collins in the background (Su-Su-Sudio)

Hope she ain't slip...on that pickup

Fuck the cash nigga, pistol whip ya ass
Me and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast
Rolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)
He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!
Used to run epps wit him back in the day
Mitch popped the trunk, passed the German AK
You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless the gat
Better take cover from the ratta-tat-tat
Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest
Three to the chest, Ed got blessed
L got life, Ed got death
The bitch took the money and she slid to the left
Back in the day, I told L she was shady
Now she in Cali about to have Ed's baby

Yo, what's the word, kid?!
Tell you bout a brother named Sid
Got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid
Cause of drug logic
Shouldn't touch it
Now out to budget
With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects
Nice job, took prison camp drives
While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle
The sweat off the brow was soon on garment
Both worked
Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment
Great statement, without delayment, away and went
Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments
But an idea concocted his stock
Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip
So he gave his man a shriek and excitement
Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment
Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck
Sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again
Black folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's...

And then the rains came
Turning us all to green and grey
Then the rains came
She said how can I love you
When I don't even know you no more
I want to feel free to believe
I want to feel free to rock your soul
And watch my words fall right off your tongue
Me and my lady rode the white falls down
We watched the sun spin our shadows
As they froze in the dust on the ground
And then the rains came
Turning us all to green and grey
Then the rains came
She said how can I love you
When I don't even know you no more
Taking my time down the lonely road
There never seemed such a burden I could handle
She said maybe I won't love you this time around
Maybe I'll get mixed up
Maybe we're all just scared of growing old she said
That's why we cry when the rain comes down

Once upon a time, when you and me lived in infinity
There were two of us, a God of love and a God of evil
Something about polarity - you know, day and night
Black and white, hot and cold, wrong and right, life and death
Polarity, without the opposite we could never be
Now this is all-knowing entity of good and evil
Decided that the place was awfully lonely
So they decided that they would create a world
Of insects and flowers and animals and birds and life untold
Worlds within a world of good things for the good
And evil things for the evil, and there was jealousy
[Verse 2]
Now comes man
Devil wanted to have all the control
But the Good Lord said
""We gonna have to share equally in this here human soul
But we will give man understanding and reason to decide
Whether to join a God of love and peace
Or burn in your eternal fire""
Lord, have mercy and stay with me
Good God said, ""I really, I really want to
Love 'em and give 'em all the things that they desire
And bless 'em and love 'em so much and
I got to give 'em reason 'cause I want 'em to come back to me
When the power of evil is all gone""
[Verse 3]
Whoa, some souls are ready to rejoin the Lord of love
Did you ever wonder why a little baby cry when he's born
His soul isn't happy 'cause we got to give up all the sin
But we coming a-home my friend until the soul is ready to be Spirit again
Good Lord don't mind, when you're ready He'll be ready
'Cause time don't mean a thing to these Lords
The Evil Lord don't mind if you're not ready
He wants you to bring your soul to him
It's a power struggle, my friend
A Buddhist monk can burn his body without a flinch
I think he's ready
[Verse 4]
The Evil Lord tempts a man with the things
Heart and the soul and the flesh
That you put on him and desire, to keep him from you:
""I don't think you shoulda did right, you give him too much power
I'll make him destroy all we created - weak and foolish, baby""
And the Good Lord said, ""No, no, I know know know
Mankind can feel my love""
And the Evil Lord said
""No, no, no, no, no, no, I want 'em all
You shouldn't have gave him reason
You shouldn't have gave him reason""
'Cause we are the soul to the mind
And the mind to the brain and the brain to the body
Get what the soul desires
And Evil said
""I got what the soul desires for mankind's flesh
Having fun, and uh, I know what they like and
I'm gonna put it on 'em, baby
'Cause your body's really nothing now
But a safe for the soul""
[Outro]

""You can listen to me, I'm in your soul
Your decision is free
I gave you reason, don't you wanna be with me, do right?""

And heaven was a drink of wine

Always in trouble need love on the double spent cake
And a lifetime climbing to the level
Contract with the devil loopholed expiration date
On the side of good people always set the record straight
Round and round the piano keys meditate
Felt in the music need it now can't let it wait
It's not a secret everything is all out and exposed
It's going down like the water in the river flows
So it goes another day another story told
Stuck inside the puzzle searching still trying to get a hold
Forgotten souls got lost in the cold trying
To get freedom now they need 'em walking down to hope road
They said they hope so but it was a no go
Front row stage show well placed logo
Fancy lights and the cameras are on
But he don't care he's just there to sing another sad love song
[Hook: Pase Rock]
Fade to black the soundtrack to another night
It's the music of the rain and the city lights
Feel no pain it makes the whole city bright
Without the sparkle or hype it's just another night

It's the music of the rain and the city lights
Feel no pain it makes the whole city bright

Substantial

And they all knew what it was from the first glance
No excuses should've planned in advance man
Documented on ProTools or Tascam
Struggles & hustles of an ordinary black man
Spin a record with two week life span
Can't find a good girl so we hug the mic stand
Not a lot of paper left in his right hand
Making enemies of folks he treated like fam
Stone cold, solid rock every point stop
What you lean on soon as the pressure drops
Ghetto hot, know the ledge and you'll hear the shot
But he'll never stop 'til his name's known on every block
Spread my wings fly away to the night beat
He's wide awake while the rest of the city sleeps
In these gritty streets, dudes creep with plenty heat
Pay it no mind and we grind losing plenty sleep
[Verse 3: Substantial]
Yo, yo
Some play for keeps while you laid asleep
In the dark your worst nightmare 
waits for he
Anything discern, no dawn or despair
Air's crisp and calm I think a storm is near
And I'm watching lightning dance across the skyline
Usually miss it, rarely find time
To bask in blackness, hint of line shine
But in a jazz pub chilling, sippin' with fine wine
Hypnotize by the strum of the upright
Feel like lost souls got their eyes on me some nights
So keep my eyes wide and move cautious
Slip and find yourself in a brand new coffin
By morning, now you're the one with the night breed
You should've known better if you're anything like me
But the city lights will seduce you
Daywalkers beware if it's not what you're used to",3.0,6.147027500002878

You know what free is, nigga?
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (
M-M
)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (
M-M
)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming ""gang gang,"" now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(
M-M-Maybach music

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like

In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, ""Is you dumb?""
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed

You ain't livin' right punk, I'll have to school you
Not rule you, but I'll say, yo, you fool yourself
When you try to deny and defy written laws
This means your cause has lost
Think about it, take the time, and even ponder longer
Then let your mind start to wander
Go black and track the facts about all of your mistakes
It only takes to one to make fate
Pick up your life, clean up your act, and get a legal plan
You can or be an evil man
Caught, and then you claim you're not responsible
The choice was yours, when the fun's gone you will realize
That you don't get somethin' for nothin', why you bluffin'?
Others even brothers are stuffin' their pockets
With honest cash, they'll laugh, so don't knock it
Jock it, 'cause the Guru must stop it
I'll jab you, smack you, crack -- you're demolished
You must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
Get a degree in reality
Or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
Gone, never to see or be the same again
Friend, 'cause the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
[Premo scratches]
[Verse 2]
Exactly what you put in boy, you will get out of it
The energy released comes back, there is no doubt of it
So when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
This means you'll bleed from greed
Dig the rhyme and dig the thought of what'll happen
You're nappin', you're gonna fall off the map 'n'
Lie out, and cry out, why? You got the short end of the stick
'Cause you ain't too quick to run tricks
Open your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut
Move, and get the lead out of your butt
'Cause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump
And you shouldn't stand to let
Anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
Chill, because you know the chosen youth will
Take over, and control the whole so don't blow it
Know it, 'cause the Guru must show it
I'll teach you, reachin' each so you're enlightened
Emcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs
'Cause I express what I manifest
While some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, because the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
[Premo scratches]
[Verse 3]
You're still playin' games lame, I'll have to end you
Straight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom
Will you decay as you pay in repentance
I light my sentence like incense
Breathe in, expel your fears as you marvel
Heed what I feed, you won't starve, you'll make it
But if you don't, you will be finished
You'll dissapear, you will diminish
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, because the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will leave you bugged and upset
'Cause homeboy life is cause and effect
Cause and effect!

Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home and he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star
He had a silver plated bus and a million country fans
Now there's just a few of us and he drives a little van
And they were beatin' down his door the lovely women left and right
And now he's on a hardwood floor a wonderin' where he'll spend the night
Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home and he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star

Hey!
Yes, like I said before, it's really groovy
I'd like to bore you for about six or seven minutes to do a little thing
Yeah
Billy, 'cuse me for a minute, just let me play that guitar, right?
Right now, we're doin' thing by Bob Dylan
This little thing called ""Like a Rolling Stone""

Once upon a time, you dressеd so fine
Threw the bums a dimе in your prime
Oh, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll
You're bound to fall""

Were all a-kiddin' you

How does it feel?
To be without a home?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

Turn it till it's turned out

It isn't the way that you talk
It isn't the things that you say or do

It is nothing to do with the wine

But never before have I been so sure

It's the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
It's a feelin' so unreal

The hoping that we'll never part

And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again

With a few dreams but nothing to show
The world was a place
With a frown on its face
And tomorrow was just, I don't know

Makes today seem so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true

Tomorrow will come but I fear

And crooked cops
We still ride though
What side? Westside

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways, ‘cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy Badass
? Nigga, you scary
I've been knowin' you for years
We was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night that killed his kids

When vision is blurry, the money is clear
Some of my peers eternally will sleep in a coffin
And when Nob' on the road, I'm extremely cautious
It happen that fast, split second you gone
At the top of my tombstone put ""Nob' was raw""
Outlaw 'til I'm under the floor, for Kadafi the Prince
I stack dough like I clocked all the bricks
With a watch on my wrist, dawg, I know the time these days
We Outlawz, we gon' die this way nigga (nigga)

When they think they was in the right
I prove they movin' wrong
I'm a hardcore product of the ghetto
Been blessed fo' sho' to eat from out the ghetto
I maneuver, in the right lane, quick to push back brains
Switchin' to the left lane, I'm playin' my hands

So when it jump off, I breathe for Yak'
Been puttin' in work, so I walk with a bop

Look out, wanted man, guns in hand, stand firm
Nuts and my pride, now let's burn
Bound to the fam going down swingin'
Holding my ground, now we the last ones breathin'
Won't stop until we even deep in the trenches
So many killings it's senseless
So in this life I lead, 
I stay protected
By God, my squad, and this thing in my palm

As free as they claim freedom to be
Things are going fast
To have found it all in the past
To have to take what you can get
Sure can make a heart upset
Inconspicuous
I must behave myself
For somebody else
That may have a little fame, fortune and wealth
It's so ridiculous
Of the strife and the bliss
To go right on through
Right on through me to have missed
All the world seems not for me
So privately
I'll be invisible
That way I won't have to explain a thing
If you know what I mean
I won't even have to be here
On the scene
It's so ridiculous
For the strife and the bliss
To go right on through
Right on through me to have missed
All the things that hurt you so
No one would ever know
Naw naw naw they'd never know
Life so preciously
Just don't seem to me
As free as they claim freedom to be
Oh Oh Oh
Things are going fast
To have found it all in the past
To have to take what you can get

Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say 
there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof-prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back
Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back?
Send them back!!
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig
I've warned all my
Friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves",2.0,3.2200422000023536

(Man says): We're gonna slow it down at this time
And sing a soulful number
This song is a song that, y' know, we all wanna sing sometime
Y' know what I mean?  This is the love crowd right?
We all love each other, don't we?
Ai-ight?  ""All right!""
Let me hear you say yea!!!!
""Yeah!!!!!""
(Verse 1)
I needed love from somewhere. Somebody to interpret
My mother was supposed to, but she's far from perfect
My body was young.  Feeling n' thoughts were so sexual
No one to explain, so my body had no schedule
And when it was right, or if the time was wrong
My nursery rhyme turned to a passionate song
So we tossed n' turned. Burning in heated sweat
No one ever explained.  There's nothing to forget
An explosion of rain like there is in a storm:
Body wet.  Heart beating.  Body burning and warm
No mama never said to say no, not even how to
Tell one from another, or what to expect to
Go for or demand, accept or reject
Or when to say yes.  And also to protect
So I had no choice.  I imitated what I saw
My mother had one man, plus three, equals four:
One for his car, one for his job, and one for spite
And one did her right as I listened in the night
(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""
(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children!
Anything you want the children to know, you must teach them!
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know
They will not know!
(Verse 2)
Now she yelled and hollered, and sometimes even screamed
And never explained quite what she would mean
Mad at the world for the way she never understood
And if she couldn't explain, what makes you think I could
So there's life in my belly-or say, ""A biscuit in the oven""-
Kicking and hitting, and pushing and shovin'
And my biggest fear is that it'll ask me those questions
All I'm qualified to give are mistakes and confessions
(Interlude)
""I never thought that this would cause so many problems
I wish I had somebody to talk to
God, I'm so confused...""
Now a cycle repeats over and over again
Make it topsy turvy: the lives of women and men
Bringing life into the world should be considered a blessin'
But it isn't
When you haven't been taught the lessons
Of motherhood...
Now, adoptions not an option. Not even abortion
Won't make the baby pay for societies distortion
Got to go for self, despite societies abuses
Schools built to destroy minds.  Upset and confused
Met a friend the other day.  She said her name was Souljah
She said, ""I'm here to tell ya what your mama never told ya.""
""Raise your child"" she said.  ""Raise your head like a warrior
If you don't, the world will destroy ya
We need your baby: mind body and soul
To reestablish the laws of the old
Wise, life-giving ways of our people.""
(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""
(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children!
Anything you want your children to know, you must teach them!
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know
They will not know!
(Verse 3)
She said, ""Girl, you're original.  And that's definite
You're first.  Your wisdom is infinite
Ex-plore your mind.  You have so much to give
If you seek knowledge, you'll have reason to live!
In a war
There can be no excuses
Two camps:
The used and the users
Your mind:
You've got to read and nourish
Your talent
Then unfolds and flourish
We can't blame your mom.  We know she did what she could
But girl, you've got to be twice as good!

And with tears streaming down my face
I slammed the door and I walked out
Swearing that we were through
Now I'm sitting in a bar
Thinking I've gone too far
Wondering what I'm going to do
Thinking about calling you
[Chorus]
To my left blue collar
To my right a high dollar man
Across the bar, a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well, they buy me drinks
Light my cigarette
They're all wondering which one I'm going to choose
Oh, my hand's on my glass
My second margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you
[Verse 2]
Well, I ran away
In a moment of weakness
I couldn't hold my own
I should stay
Because being together
Means more than who was right or wrong
And sitting in a room full of lonely faces
You're the only one I see
If you only knew
I was thinking of you
Would you come and rescue me
Maybe I should call and see
[Chorus]
To my left blue collar
To my right a high dollar man
Across the bar, a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well, they buy me drinks
Light my cigarette
They're all wondering which one I'm going to choose
Oh, my hand's on my glass
My second margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you
To my left blue collar
To my right a high dollar man
Across the bar, a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well, they buy me drinks
Light my cigarette
They're all wondering which one I'm going to choose
Oh, my hand's on my glass
My second margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you",1.0,2.273700000005192

What's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, come on it soothes my soul
Oh, let the good times roll, come on, come on, come on
A lot of people live in make-believe
They keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve
My love, baby ain't the kind to fold
Come one baby, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, come on and let it roll
Ah yeah, let it roll, come on, let it roll
Our lovin's nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you feel so good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
Come on sugar, let the good times roll
Oh, let the good times roll, come on let it roll, come on, come on
Come on, come on, let it roll",2.0,3.2752903000000515

I'd lie for you
I'd kick and scream and do time for you
I'd rob and steal and go without meals and
Terrorize this town
For you-for you
Like an outlaw
I'd lurk in the baddest parts of town
I'd wait there for you baby
Until they hunt me down
For you-for you
Like an outlaw
They'd put a price on my head
Wanted dead or alive or painted a bloodied red
For you-for you
Like an outlaw
I'd kill for you
I'd kick and scream and hang for you
I'd go inside and kick some hide and
Bury a man who died
For you-for you",1.0,2.907003000000259
