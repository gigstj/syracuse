IST 769: Advanced Big Data Management

An analysis of relational and non-relational databases and their corresponding database management system architectures. Learn to build complex database objects to support a variety of needs from big data and traditional perspectives. Data systems performance, scalability, security.

Learning Objectives

Demonstrate comprehension of advanced issues with the relational database model such as transactions, performance, and security as to understand the need for other database models.  
Compare different database models such as document, key-value, column-family, streaming, search, graph, object and relational.  
Identify the most suitable database systems for a specific application’s data storage requirements.  
Explain the CAP theorem, which identifies a systems trade-offs of partition tolerance, availability, and consistency as to describe how any given database system’s architecture fits within this context.  
Evaluate relational, Hadoop, and noSQL database tooling as to understand their underlying similarities and necessary differences.
